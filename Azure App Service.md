- Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. 

- App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for running App Service apps. It offers improved security at high scale.

Unlike the App Service offering, where supporting infrastructure is shared, with App Service Environment, compute is dedicated to a single customer.

- In App Service, an app always runs in an App Service plan. An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run. One or more apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources (or in the same App Service plan).

- In the Free and Shared tiers, an app receives CPU minutes on a shared VM instance and can't scale out.
