# **C# Interview Questions for Tech Lead (25)**

### 1. What are the differences between `struct` and `class` in C#?

**Answer:**

* `struct` is a value type, stored in the stack.
* `class` is a reference type, stored in the heap.
* `struct` does not support inheritance (except from interfaces).
* `class` supports inheritance.

**Example:**

```csharp
struct Point
{
    public int X, Y;
}

class Person
{
    public string Name;
}
```

**Explanation:**
When you copy a struct, a full copy of the data is made. With classes, only the reference is copied.

**Follow-up Q:** Can a `struct` have a parameterless constructor?
**A:** No. Before C# 10, structs could not have explicit parameterless constructors. From C# 10 onwards, you can define parameterless constructors.

---

### 2. What is the difference between `ref` and `out` parameters?

**Answer:**

* `ref`: The variable must be initialized before being passed.
* `out`: The variable must be assigned within the method before returning.

**Example:**

```csharp
void Add(ref int x, int y) { x += y; }
void Multiply(out int result, int x, int y) { result = x * y; }
```

**Explanation:**
`ref` allows both input and output, while `out` is output-only.

**Follow-up Q:** Can `ref` and `out` be used with async methods?
**A:** No, they cannot because async methods return control before completion.

---

### 3. What are extension methods in C#?

**Answer:**
Extension methods allow adding new methods to existing types without modifying them.

**Example:**

```csharp
public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static bool IsCapitalized(this string str)
    {
        return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(str) && char.IsUpper(str[0]);
    }
}

Console.WriteLine("Hello".IsCapitalized()); // true
```

**Explanation:**
The `this` keyword before the parameter indicates it is an extension method.

**Follow-up Q:** Can extension methods override existing methods?
**A:** No, they only provide additional methods, not overrides.

---

### 4. Explain the difference between `IEnumerable`, `ICollection`, and `IList`.

**Answer:**

* `IEnumerable`: Only forward iteration.
* `ICollection`: Adds size and add/remove methods.
* `IList`: Allows indexed access.

**Example:**

```csharp
IEnumerable<int> nums = new List<int> {1,2,3};
ICollection<int> collection = new List<int>();
IList<int> list = new List<int>();
```

**Explanation:**
These interfaces define different levels of collection operations.

**Follow-up Q:** Which one would you use to improve read-only performance?
**A:** `IEnumerable`, since it has minimal overhead.

---

### 5. What is the difference between `abstract` class and `interface`?

**Answer:**

* `abstract` class: Can contain implementation + abstract members.
* `interface`: Cannot have implementation (until default interface methods in C# 8).

**Example:**

```csharp
abstract class Animal { public abstract void Speak(); }
interface IAnimal { void Speak(); }
```

**Explanation:**
Abstract classes define shared base implementations; interfaces define contracts.

**Follow-up Q:** Can an abstract class implement an interface?
**A:** Yes, it can, and can also provide partial implementations.

---

### 6. Explain `async` and `await` in C#.

**Answer:**
They are used for asynchronous programming without blocking threads.

**Example:**

```csharp
async Task<int> FetchData()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return 42;
}
```

**Explanation:**
`await` suspends execution until the task is complete.

**Follow-up Q:** What happens if you forget to use `await`?
**A:** The method runs synchronously and may not complete as expected.

---

### 7. What is Dependency Injection (DI)?

**Answer:**
DI is a design pattern to achieve loose coupling by injecting dependencies instead of hardcoding them.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IMessageService { void Send(string msg); }
public class EmailService : IMessageService { public void Send(string msg) {} }
public class Notification { private IMessageService _service;
    public Notification(IMessageService service) { _service = service; }
}
```

**Explanation:**
DI makes code more testable and maintainable.

**Follow-up Q:** What are the DI lifetimes in .NET Core?
**A:** Transient, Scoped, Singleton.

---

### 8. What is the difference between `Task` and `Thread`?

**Answer:**

* `Thread`: OS-level thread, heavyweight.
* `Task`: Abstraction over threads, lightweight, used in TPL.

**Example:**

```csharp
Task.Run(() => Console.WriteLine("Running"));
```

**Explanation:**
Tasks are preferred for async workloads; threads are for low-level control.

**Follow-up Q:** Can multiple tasks run on the same thread?
**A:** Yes, via the thread pool.

---

### 9. Explain `yield return` in C#.

**Answer:**
It allows creating an iterator without building a collection.

**Example:**

```csharp
IEnumerable<int> GetNumbers()
{
    for(int i=1; i<=3; i++) yield return i;
}
```

**Explanation:**
Execution state is preserved between iterations.

**Follow-up Q:** Can `yield return` be used inside `async` methods?
**A:** No, but `IAsyncEnumerable` with `await foreach` can be used in C# 8+.

---

### 10. Explain the difference between `lock` and `Monitor`.

**Answer:**
Both provide synchronization. `lock` is syntactic sugar for `Monitor.Enter` and `Monitor.Exit`.

**Example:**

```csharp
lock(obj) { // critical section }
```

**Explanation:**
`Monitor` offers more features like `TryEnter`, `Wait`, `Pulse`.

**Follow-up Q:** Which is more flexible?
**A:** `Monitor`.

# **C# Advanced Interview Questions (Tech Lead / Solution Architect) – Part 2**

---

### 11. Explain Garbage Collection (GC) in .NET.

**Answer:**
GC automatically reclaims unused memory by removing objects no longer referenced. It works in generations (0, 1, 2, LOH).

**Example:**

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var obj = new object();
        obj = null;
        GC.Collect(); // forces collection (not recommended)
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Gen 0: short-lived objects (local variables).
* Gen 1: promoted from Gen 0.
* Gen 2: long-lived objects.
* Large Object Heap (LOH): > 85KB objects.

**Follow-up Q:** Why is calling `GC.Collect()` discouraged?
**A:** It forces collection prematurely, harming performance. Let the runtime manage it.

---

### 12. What is the difference between `finalize` and `dispose` in C#?

**Answer:**

* `finalize`: Called by GC before reclaiming memory.
* `dispose`: Manually free unmanaged resources.

**Example:**

```csharp
class Resource : IDisposable
{
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dispose called");
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
    ~Resource() { Console.WriteLine("Finalize called"); }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Use `Dispose` for deterministic cleanup (e.g., DB connections).
* `Finalize` is non-deterministic.

**Follow-up Q:** When to use `SafeHandle` instead of finalizer?
**A:** Always prefer `SafeHandle` for unmanaged resources (file handles, sockets).

---

### 13. Explain covariance and contravariance in C#.

**Answer:**
They define how generic type parameters behave in inheritance.

**Example:**

```csharp
IEnumerable<object> objs = new List<string>(); // covariance
Action<string> act = (s) => Console.WriteLine(s);
Action<object> act2 = act; // contravariance
```

**Explanation:**

* Covariance: allows derived → base (`out`).
* Contravariance: allows base → derived (`in`).

**Follow-up Q:** Can classes support covariance/contravariance?
**A:** No, only interfaces and delegates.

---

### 14. What are `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>` in C#?

**Answer:**
They provide efficient access to memory without extra allocations.

**Example:**

```csharp
Span<int> numbers = stackalloc int[3] {1, 2, 3};
numbers[0] = 42;
```

**Explanation:**

* `Span<T>`: stack-only.
* `Memory<T>`: heap-safe alternative, usable with async methods.

**Follow-up Q:** Why is `Span<T>` important for performance?
**A:** It avoids copying arrays and reduces heap allocations.

---

### 15. Explain async streams (`IAsyncEnumerable<T>`).

**Answer:**
Async streams allow iterating over data asynchronously.

**Example:**

```csharp
async IAsyncEnumerable<int> Generate()
{
    for(int i=0; i<3; i++)
    {
        await Task.Delay(500);
        yield return i;
    }
}

await foreach(var n in Generate())
    Console.WriteLine(n);
```

**Explanation:**
Unlike normal `IEnumerable`, async streams can yield values while awaiting.

**Follow-up Q:** Which .NET version introduced async streams?
**A:** C# 8 with .NET Core 3.0.

---

### 16. What are expression trees in C#?

**Answer:**
They represent code in a tree structure, useful for dynamic query generation (e.g., LINQ).

**Example:**

```csharp
Expression<Func<int, bool>> expr = x => x > 10;
Console.WriteLine(expr.Body); // prints (x > 10)
```

**Explanation:**
Expression trees are widely used in LINQ to SQL/EF Core.

**Follow-up Q:** How are they different from delegates?
**A:** Delegates execute code, expression trees represent code structure.

---

### 17. What is `dynamic` in C#?

**Answer:**
`dynamic` bypasses compile-time type checking.

**Example:**

```csharp
dynamic obj = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(obj.Length);
```

**Explanation:**
The compiler defers type resolution until runtime. Useful for COM, reflection, and interop.

**Follow-up Q:** What’s the performance impact of `dynamic`?
**A:** Slower than static typing because of runtime binding.

---

### 18. Explain reflection in C#.

**Answer:**
Reflection allows inspecting metadata at runtime.

**Example:**

```csharp
var type = typeof(string);
foreach (var method in type.GetMethods())
    Console.WriteLine(method.Name);
```

**Explanation:**
Used for dynamic loading, DI, serialization, etc.

**Follow-up Q:** How to improve reflection performance?

**A:** Use `Expression.Compile()` or `Delegate.CreateDelegate`.

---

### 19. What is the difference between value types and reference types in memory?

**Answer:**

* Value types: Stored in stack (unless boxed).
* Reference types: Stored in heap.

**Example:**

```csharp
int x = 5; // value type
string s = "test"; // reference type
```

**Explanation:**
Value types are copied, reference types share references.

**Follow-up Q:** What is boxing/unboxing?
**A:** Boxing: value → object, Unboxing: object → value.

---

### 20. What is the difference between `ConcurrentDictionary` and `Dictionary`?

**Answer:**

* `Dictionary`: not thread-safe.
* `ConcurrentDictionary`: thread-safe with lock-free reads.

**Example:**

```csharp
var dict = new ConcurrentDictionary<int, string>();
dict.TryAdd(1, "One");
```

**Explanation:**
Concurrent collections provide safe multi-threaded access.

**Follow-up Q:** When would you prefer `ReaderWriterLockSlim` over `ConcurrentDictionary`?

**A:** When read-heavy and dictionary operations need complex atomic updates.

---

### 21. Explain the difference between `Select`, `SelectMany`, and `Where` in LINQ.

**Answer:**

* `Select`: Projects each element.
* `SelectMany`: Flattens collections.
* `Where`: Filters elements.

**Example:**

```csharp
var data = new List<string> { "abc", "de" };
var chars = data.SelectMany(s => s.ToCharArray());
```

**Explanation:**
`SelectMany` is useful for flattening hierarchical data.

**Follow-up Q:** Can `SelectMany` be replaced with nested loops?
**A:** Yes, but LINQ is more expressive and composable.

---

### 22. What are nullable reference types in C#?

**Answer:**
Introduced in C# 8, they add compile-time null safety.

**Example:**

```csharp
string? nullable = null;
string nonNull = "Hello";
```

**Explanation:**
The compiler warns if a non-nullable variable might be null.

**Follow-up Q:** How do you disable nullable reference warnings?
**A:** `#nullable disable`.

---

### 23. Explain `record` types in C#.

**Answer:**
Records are immutable reference types with built-in equality.

**Example:**

```csharp
public record Person(string Name, int Age);
```

**Explanation:**
They are useful for DTOs, equality comparisons, and immutability.

**Follow-up Q:** Can records be mutable?
**A:** Yes, with `init` properties.

---

### 24. What are `Delegates` and `Events`?

**Answer:**

* Delegate: Type-safe function pointer.
* Event: Encapsulation of delegates, restricted to `+=` and `-=`.

**Example:**

```csharp
public delegate void Notify(string msg);
public event Notify OnNotify;

OnNotify?.Invoke("Hello");
```

**Explanation:**
Events implement the Observer pattern.

**Follow-up Q:** What’s the difference between `Action`, `Func`, and `Predicate`?
**A:**

* `Action`: returns void.
* `Func`: returns value.
* `Predicate`: returns bool.

---

### 25. How would you implement caching in C#?

**Answer:**
Use in-memory caching (`MemoryCache`) or distributed caching (`Redis`).

**Example:**

```csharp
var cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions());
cache.Set("key", "value", TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
```

**Explanation:**
Caching reduces database/API calls, improving performance.

```

**Follow-up Q:** What’s the difference between HTML Helpers and Tag Helpers?
**A:** Tag Helpers (in Core) use HTML-like syntax, more natural for designers.

---

### 7. Explain Model Binding in MVC.

**Answer:**
Model Binding maps request data (query string, form, JSON) to controller parameters.

**Example:**

```csharp
public ActionResult Save(Product product)
{
    // product.Name auto-bound from form
}
```

**Follow-up Q:** How to customize model binding?
**A:** Create a custom model binder by inheriting `IModelBinder`.

---

### 8. What is the difference between `ActionResult` and `ViewResult`?

**Answer:**

* `ActionResult`: Base class, supports multiple return types.
* `ViewResult`: Specific for rendering views.

**Follow-up Q:** Can you return JSON in MVC?
**A:** Yes, with `JsonResult`.

---

### 9. How does Routing work in MVC?

**Answer:**
Uses route templates to map URL → Controller/Action.

# Web API — Tech Lead (25 advanced questions)

1. Question: What is the purpose of RESTful Web APIs and what are REST constraints?
   Answer: RESTful APIs expose resources over HTTP using stateless communication and standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Constraints: client-server, statelessness, cacheability, uniform interface, layered system, code on demand (optional).
   Explanation: Following REST constraints leads to scalable, evolvable APIs. Uniform interface implies resource-based URIs, standard methods, and hypermedia where applicable. Statelessness means each request contains all state needed. Cacheability improves performance.
   Code example: GET product by id (ASP.NET Core):

   ```csharp
   [HttpGet("{id}")]
   public ActionResult<ProductDto> Get(int id) => Ok(_repo.GetById(id));
   ```

   Follow-up: When might you *not* use a pure REST approach?
   Answer: For high-performance inter-service comms (use gRPC), complex queries that benefit from GraphQL, or when transactional/coordinated operations require RPC-like semantics.

2. Question: How do you design resource URIs and why is it important?
   Answer: URIs should identify resources (nouns), be hierarchical, and avoid verbs. Example: /api/orders/{orderId}/items. Good design simplifies caching, routing, and discoverability.
   Explanation: Well-designed URIs make APIs intuitive and support HATEOAS. Avoid encoding actions in URI; use HTTP verbs for actions. Use plural nouns for collections.
   Code example:

   ```csharp
   [Route("api/orders/{orderId}/items")]
   public class OrderItemsController : ControllerBase { ... }
   ```

   Follow-up: Should query parameters be used for filtering or identification?
   Answer: Use query parameters for filtering, sorting, paging; keep identifiers in the path.

3. Question: Explain HTTP status code best practices for Web APIs.
   Answer: Use semantically correct status codes: 200 OK, 201 Created (with Location header), 204 No Content, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict, 500 Internal Server Error.
   Explanation: Correct codes enable clients and intermediaries to react appropriately and integrate with HTTP caching and retries. Include a structured error body for 4xx/5xx.
   Code example (create):

   ```csharp
   [HttpPost]
   public IActionResult Create(ProductCreateDto dto) {
       var id = _service.Create(dto);
       return CreatedAtAction(nameof(Get), new { id }, null);
   }
   ```

   Follow-up: When to use 202 Accepted?
   Answer: When request accepted for asynchronous processing and result not immediately available.

4. Question: How does content negotiation work in ASP.NET Core Web API?
   Answer: The framework inspects Accept header and available formatters (JSON, XML) to choose a media type. You can configure formatters and use \[Produces] or \[Consumes] attributes to control allowed types.
   Explanation: Content negotiation allows APIs to serve multiple formats. Default is JSON via System.Text.Json or Newtonsoft.Json.
   Code example:

   ```csharp
   services.AddControllers().AddXmlSerializerFormatters();
   [Produces("application/json", "application/xml")]
   public IActionResult Get() => Ok(data);
   ```

   Follow-up: How to force JSON only?
   Answer: Remove other formatters and/or use \[Produces("application/json")].

5. Question: Explain model binding and validation pipeline in ASP.NET Core.
   Answer: Model binding maps incoming data (route, query, headers, body, form) to parameters or models. Validation runs after binding using data annotations and IValidatableObject; ModelState indicates validation results.
   Explanation: Place validation attributes on DTOs; always check ModelState in controller (or use automatic validation in ApiController). Use custom model binders for special types.
   Code example:

   ```csharp
   public class ProductDto { [Required] public string Name { get; set; } }
   [HttpPost]
   public IActionResult Create([FromBody] ProductDto dto) {
       if (!ModelState.IsValid) return BadRequest(ModelState);
       ...
   }
   ```

   Follow-up: How to create a custom model binder?
   Answer: Implement IModelBinder and register with ModelBinderProviders or \[ModelBinder] attribute.

6. Question: What are best practices for DTOs vs domain models in Web APIs?
   Answer: Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for the API contract; do not expose domain or ORM entities directly. Map between domain and DTOs with AutoMapper or manual mapping.
   Explanation: DTOs allow versioning, avoid over-posting, hide internal fields, and decouple API from persistence. Keep DTOs lean and explicit.
   Code example:

   ```csharp
   var dto = _mapper.Map<ProductDto>(productEntity);
   ```

   Follow-up: How to prevent over-posting?
   Answer: Use DTOs with only allowed fields and avoid binding directly to entities.

7. Question: How to implement pagination, filtering, and sorting in APIs?
   Answer: Use query parameters: page, pageSize, sortBy, sortOrder, filters. Return metadata (total count, page info) and data. Consider cursor-based pagination for large result sets.
   Explanation: Avoid transferring large datasets. Cursor pagination performs better for high-volume data and is stable for inserts/deletes. Provide links (self, next, prev) for convenience (HATEOAS style).
   Code example:

   ```csharp
   [HttpGet]
   public IActionResult Get([FromQuery]int page=1, [FromQuery]int pageSize=20) {
       var (items, total) = _service.GetPage(page, pageSize);
       Response.Headers.Add("X-Total-Count", total.ToString());
       return Ok(items);
   }
   ```

   Follow-up: When use cursor vs offset pagination?
   Answer: Cursor for large, frequently changing data; offset for simple cases.

8. Question: How do you implement idempotency for POST endpoints?
   Answer: Use an idempotency key provided by the client; server stores the key with the result. If the same key is received again, return the stored response rather than performing the operation again.
   Explanation: Prevents duplicate processing on retries (important for payments). Key stored in durable store (DB or cache with enough TTL).
   Code example (conceptual):

   ```csharp
   if (_idempotencyStore.TryGet(key, out response)) return response;
   var result = _service.Process(request);
   _idempotencyStore.Save(key, result);
   return result;
   ```

   Follow-up: Where to place idempotency key in HTTP?
   Answer: Use a custom header (e.g., Idempotency-Key) or a client-generated resource id.

9. Question: What is HATEOAS and should you use it?
   Answer: HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) embeds links in responses to guide clients. It makes APIs discoverable but adds complexity. Use when you want strict REST hypermedia-driven clients; many public APIs omit it for simplicity.
   Explanation: With HATEOAS, clients follow links rather than hardcoding URIs. It can be helpful in evolving APIs and workflows.
   Code example (simplified):

   ```json
   { "id":1, "name":"a", "_links": { "self": "/api/products/1", "buy":"/api/orders" } }
   ```

   Follow-up: How to implement HATEOAS in .NET Core?
   Answer: Add link-building logic in DTOs or use libraries like WebApi.Hal.

10. Question: How do you secure Web APIs (authentication and authorization)?
    Answer: Use strong authentication (OAuth2 / OpenID Connect) and token-based auth (JWT). Use authorization policies and role/claim-based checks. Enforce HTTPS, validate tokens, and apply scopes.
    Explanation: Use IdentityServer or managed identity providers (Azure AD, Auth0). Validate tokens at gateway/microservice boundary; do not rely on client assertions. Employ least privilege.
    Code example:

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
      .AddJwtBearer(options => { options.Authority = "https://auth"; 
                                 options.Audience = "api"; });
    [Authorize(Policy = "CanReadProducts")]
    public IActionResult Get() => Ok();
    ```

    Follow-up: When to use API keys vs OAuth?
    Answer: API keys are simple (for service-to-service or internal use); OAuth is recommended for user-authenticated scenarios and delegated access.

11. Question: Explain token validation and common JWT pitfalls.
    Answer: Validate issuer, audience, expiry, signature, and token revocation as needed. Avoid storing sensitive session in JWT payload. Use short lifetimes and refresh tokens. Use asymmetric signing (RS256) for distributed systems.
    Explanation: JWT can be tampered if signature validation is skipped; long-lived tokens make revocation hard. Use introspection for opaque tokens.
    Code example: configuration of JwtBearer has TokenValidationParameters for these checks.
    Follow-up: How to handle token revocation?
    Answer: Maintain a revocation list in a fast store, or use reference tokens with introspection.

12. Question: How to implement rate limiting and throttling?
    Answer: Use API gateway or middleware to limit requests per client key/IP. Implement quotas and throttling policies; return 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header. Use Redis for distributed counters.
    Explanation: Protects resources and prevents abuse. Differentiate between global and per-user limits. Use leaky bucket or token bucket algorithms.
    Code example (conceptual): use AspNetCoreRateLimit or custom middleware backed by Redis.
    Follow-up: How to handle bursts?
    Answer: Allow short bursts with token bucket; implement grace periods or prioritized queues.

13. Question: What are best practices for error handling and structured error responses?
    Answer: Centralize error handling with middleware; return consistent error format (code, message, details, traceId). Do not leak sensitive info. Use correlation IDs for troubleshooting.
    Explanation: Clients can parse error formats to show user-friendly messages and implement client-side retries. Logging should capture stack traces.
    Code example (global handler):

    ```csharp
    app.UseExceptionHandler(errorApp => { /* map exceptions to codes and log */ });
    ```

    Follow-up: What info should be included for developers vs users?
    Answer: User-facing message for end user; developer message (stack trace) only in logs or behind a debug flag.

14. Question: How to implement request/response logging without leaking sensitive data?
    Answer: Use middleware to log structured data and redact sensitive fields (PII, auth tokens). Use sampling for high volume. Use correlation IDs and log levels.
    Explanation: Full body logging can be useful but expensive and risky. Redact or hash sensitive data. Store logs centrally.
    Code example: capture request ID and log path, method, response code via ILogger.
    Follow-up: How to safely log credentials or payment data?
    Answer: Never log raw credentials or card data; log only masked or tokenized representation and use PCI-compliant solutions.

15. Question: Describe streaming responses in Web API and when to use them.
    Answer: Streaming sends data incrementally (e.g., large files, SSE, server push) using streaming endpoints to reduce memory overhead. Use FileStreamResult or PushStreamContent equivalents.
    Explanation: Avoid loading entire payload in memory; stream from disk or DB to response. Also used for real-time feeds.
    Code example:

    ```csharp
    [HttpGet("download/{id}")]
    public IActionResult Download(int id) {
       var stream = _storage.OpenRead(id);
       return File(stream, "application/octet-stream", "file.bin");
    }
    ```

    Follow-up: How to handle cancellation during streaming?
    Answer: Respect HttpContext.RequestAborted CancellationToken to stop processing.

16. Question: How to implement file uploads securely and efficiently?
    Answer: Validate content type and size, store files outside web root or in blob storage, scan for malware, use streaming uploads (not memory buffers), and generate unique filenames.
    Explanation: Avoid in-memory buffering for large files. Keep uploads on disk/temp or stream to cloud storage. Enforce auth and quota.
    Code example (streaming):

    ```csharp
    public async Task<IActionResult> Upload(IFormFile file) {
        using var stream = file.OpenReadStream();
        await _blob.UploadAsync(stream, file.FileName);
        return Ok();
    }
    ```

    Follow-up: How to prevent zip-slip attacks?
    Answer: Sanitize file paths and never trust client-provided paths; validate file names.

17. Question: Explain optimistic vs pessimistic concurrency in Web APIs.
    Answer: Optimistic concurrency assumes conflicts are rare; use ETag or version fields and reject updates if version mismatch. Pessimistic locks resources during operations (rare in APIs).
    Explanation: Use ETag header with If-Match to implement optimistic concurrency for HTTP PUT/PATCH. Pessimistic locking is costly and hard in distributed systems.
    Code example (ETag): return ETag on GET, require If-Match on update.
    Follow-up: How to implement ETag generation?
    Answer: Use version fields from DB (rowversion) or compute content hash.

18. Question: When to use PATCH vs PUT vs POST?
    Answer: POST - create resource or non-idempotent action. PUT - full replace of a resource and should be idempotent. PATCH - partial update with patch document (RFC 6902 JSON Patch), typically idempotent if designed so.
    Explanation: Use PATCH to minimize payload for partial updates; ensure validation of patch document.
    Code example (JSON Patch):

    ```csharp
    [HttpPatch("{id}")]
    public IActionResult Patch(int id, 
                               [FromBody] JsonPatchDocument<ProductDto> patch) { ... }
    ```

    Follow-up: Is PATCH always idempotent?
    Answer: Not necessarily; design operations carefully or use operation idempotency keys.

19. Question: How to version APIs safely without breaking clients?
    Answer: Use URI versioning, header versioning, or content negotiation. Keep backward compatibility, deprecate politely, provide migration docs, and support multiple versions concurrently with automated tests.
    Explanation: Semantic versioning of APIs and clear deprecation timeline reduce client friction. Automate contract tests.
    Code example: configure ApiVersioning package and decorate controllers with \[ApiVersion("1.0")].
    Follow-up: Which versioning strategy is preferred for REST?
    Answer: Header-based is clean, URI is explicit; choose based on client needs.

20. Question: How to implement health checks and readiness probes?
    Answer: Provide endpoints that check dependencies (DB, cache, external APIs) and return status; integrate with orchestrators (Kubernetes readiness/liveness). Use Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.
    Explanation: Liveness indicates if app is alive; readiness indicates if it can serve traffic. Avoid expensive checks in liveness.
    Code example:

    ```csharp
    services.AddHealthChecks().AddSqlServer(connStr).AddRedis(redisConn);
    app.UseHealthChecks("/health");
    ```

    Follow-up: What to include in readiness vs liveness checks?
    Answer: Readiness - DB, cache, message broker; Liveness - basic app process check.

21. Question: How to implement OpenAPI/Swagger documentation and ensure it stays accurate?
    Answer: Use Swashbuckle or NSwag to generate OpenAPI from controllers and XML comments. Include request/response schemas, examples, and security definitions. Embed contract tests or use tests that validate documentation against runtime responses.
    Explanation: Keep documentation close to code and part of CI pipelines. Use code examples and try it out in Swagger UI.
    Code example:

    ```csharp
    services.AddSwaggerGen(c => { c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo{Title="API"}); });
    app.UseSwagger(); app.UseSwaggerUI();
    ```

    Follow-up: How to document versions?
    Answer: Configure Swagger generation per API version and expose multiple docs.

22. Question: How to test Web APIs (unit, integration, contract)?
    Answer: Unit test controllers/services by mocking dependencies (Moq). Use integration tests with TestServer or WebApplicationFactory to run the pipeline. Use contract tests (Pact) for provider/consumer compatibility.
    Explanation: Unit tests check logic; integration tests validate routing, filters, middleware; contract tests ensure inter-service stability.
    Code example (integration):

    ```csharp
    var factory = new WebApplicationFactory<Startup>();
    var client = factory.CreateClient();
    var resp = await client.GetAsync("/api/products");
    ```

    Follow-up: Why use in-memory DBs cautiously in integration tests?
    Answer: In-memory DBs can behave differently than SQL server (e.g., relational constraints), so prefer test containers or real DB instances where possible.

23. Question: How to implement CORS safely for Web APIs?
    Answer: Configure allowed origins, methods, and headers explicitly; avoid AllowAnyOrigin in production. Use pre-flight caching with Access-Control-Max-Age.
    Explanation: CORS is a browser client security feature; servers should define which origins are allowed. For private APIs, restrict to trusted domains or use authentication.
    Code example:

    ```csharp
    services.AddCors(opts => opts.AddPolicy("policy", 
           b => b.WithOrigins("https://app.example.com")
                 .AllowAnyMethod().AllowAnyHeader()));
    app.UseCors("policy");
    ```

    Follow-up: How to handle credentials in CORS?
    Answer: Use AllowCredentials and specific origin (cannot use wildcard).

24. Question: Explain when to use synchronous vs asynchronous controllers and how to implement cancellation.
    Answer: Use async for IO-bound operations (DB, HTTP calls, disk) to free threads and increase scalability. Pass CancellationToken from HttpContext.RequestAborted to downstream operations and long-running tasks.
    Explanation: Synchronously blocking threads reduces throughput under load. Use async/await end-to-end.
    Code example:

    ```csharp
    public async Task<IActionResult> Get(CancellationToken ct) {
        var result = await _service.GetAsync(ct);
        return Ok(result);
    }
    ```

    Follow-up: What happens if you ignore the cancellation token?
    Answer: Work continues despite client disconnects, wasting resources.

25. Question: How to secure and version long-term public APIs while supporting backward compatibility?
    Answer: Apply API versioning, robust deprecation policies, semantic versioning, and maintain backwards-compatible behavior where possible. Use feature toggles and parallel version deployments. Provide SDKs or client libraries to ease migration. Monitor usage and error rates across versions.
    Explanation: Breaking changes should be minimized; if required, provide migration guides and sunset periods. Automated compatibility checks help.
    Follow-up: What metrics to monitor for deprecation readiness?
    Answer: Active clients per version, error rates, adoption rates of newer versions, and traffic shares.

# Web API — Solution Architect (25 architecture-level questions)

1. Question: How do you design an API ecosystem (gateway, internal services, clients)?
   Answer: Use an API Gateway as the single entry (routing, auth, rate-limit, TLS termination). Backend services are microservices or BFFs for client-specific needs. Gateway performs coarse-grain aggregation; services expose internal APIs and are secured. Use service mesh for east-west concerns.
   Explanation: The gateway centralizes cross-cutting concerns, reduces client complexity, and provides policy enforcement. BFF reduces chattiness and tailors APIs per client (web, mobile).
   Follow-up: When to use a BFF layer?
   Answer: When clients have different data/latency needs or to offload composition from clients.

2. Question: How to choose between REST, gRPC, and GraphQL in an architecture?
   Answer: Use REST for general-purpose, public-facing APIs; gRPC for high-performance internal RPC/microservices with streaming; GraphQL for flexible client-driven queries (complex UI needs). Consider compatibility, tooling, and team expertise.
   Explanation: Each has trade-offs: REST is simple and cache-friendly; gRPC is efficient but not browser-native; GraphQL reduces over/under fetching but can increase server complexity and complicate caching.
   Follow-up: How to combine them?
   Answer: Use hybrid architecture: API Gateway for REST/GraphQL for clients, gRPC for inter-service comms.

3. Question: How to design for API scalability and performance?
   Answer: Make services stateless, scale horizontally, use distributed caches, async processing queues, and database read replicas/sharding. Profile endpoints, add caching layers (CDN, Redis), and employ connection pooling and efficient serialization.
   Explanation: Scalability requires removing single points of contention and reducing per-request compute. Use backpressure patterns and autoscaling.
   Follow-up: How to handle sudden traffic spikes?
   Answer: Autoscale, use queueing for background processing, rate-limiting at the gateway, and cache warm-up strategies.

4. Question: How to design API security at the enterprise level?
   Answer: Centralize authentication (OIDC), use OAuth2 for authorization, implement mTLS for service-to-service calls if needed, enforce RBAC/ABAC policies, and perform regular security scans and penetration testing. Use WAF and API security gateways.
   Explanation: Use least privilege, token validation, and guardrails like input validation and content scanning. Secure CI/CD and secret management.
   Follow-up: How to secure service-to-service traffic across clusters?
   Answer: Use service mesh with mutual TLS and identity-based policies.

5. Question: How to design API contract management and versioning strategy?
   Answer: Treat API contracts as first-class artifacts (OpenAPI). Use semantic versioning and a clear deprecation policy. Automate contract testing and publish docs and SDKs. Support multiple versions concurrently if needed.
   Explanation: Contract-first design reduces integration friction and enables automation (client SDKs, stubs).
   Follow-up: How to enforce contract changes?
   Answer: Require backward-compatibility checks in CI or block changes that break consumers using contract tests.

6. Question: How to handle distributed transactions across microservices?
   Answer: Avoid two-phase commits. Use Saga patterns (choreography or orchestration) for eventually consistent distributed transactions. Compensating actions rollback work when necessary.
   Explanation: Distributed ACID is complex and often impractical; Sagas provide pragmatic consistency with compensations.
   Follow-up: When to use orchestration vs choreography?
   Answer: Orchestration gives a central coordinator (simpler to observe); choreography is decentralized and more scalable but harder to reason about.

7. Question: How to ensure API observability and troubleshooting?
   Answer: Implement distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), structured logging with correlation IDs, and metrics (Prometheus, Application Insights). Build dashboards and alerts for SLA breaches. Capture traces for slow/failed requests.
   Explanation: Observability enables root-cause analysis across services. Correlate logs across systems via trace IDs.
   Follow-up: What sampling strategy to use for traces?
   Answer: Use adaptive sampling: capture all errors and a sample of success traces to balance cost vs coverage.

8. Question: How to design for multi-region/high availability APIs?
   Answer: Deploy services to multiple regions, use geo-load balancing and active-active replication with eventual consistency for non-critical data. For critical consistency, use leader-based approaches with failover. Use global caches and CDNs for static content.
   Explanation: Multi-region increases resilience and reduces latency but complicates data consistency and latency-sensitive writes.
   Follow-up: How to handle cross-region database replication latency?
   Answer: Use read replicas for reads and route writes to primary region or use conflict-resolution strategies for multi-master setups.

9. Question: How to manage API lifecycle and governance?
   Answer: Define API lifecycle (design, build, test, publish, deprecate). Use API catalog, access control, quotas, SLA definitions, and automated policies in gateway. Implement analytics and usage plans for teams.
   Explanation: Governance ensures discoverability, consistency, and compliance across many teams.
   Follow-up: How to enforce policies digitally?
   Answer: Use API management platforms (Azure API Management, Kong, Apigee) to enforce policies and collect metrics.

10. Question: How to design API caching strategy across layers?
    Answer: Cache at CDN for static assets, reverse proxy for responses, application-level in-memory or distributed cache for computed data, DB query caching and read replicas. Use cache invalidation policies and consider cache coherence.
    Explanation: Different caches serve different purposes; invalidation is the hardest part. Prefer event-driven invalidation for consistency.
    Follow-up: How to avoid stale data for strongly consistent requirements?
    Answer: Use short TTLs, cache-aside with invalidation events, or avoid caching for critical data.

11. Question: How to manage backward compatibility when refactoring microservices?
    Answer: Use adapter layers, semantic versioning, contract tests, and the Strangler Fig pattern to incrementally replace functionality. Provide backward-compatible facades and support both old and new versions during migration.
    Explanation: Gradual replacement reduces risk and customer impact.
    Follow-up: How to detect client usages of deprecated endpoints?
    Answer: Collect usage metrics and log version headers to identify active consumers.

12. Question: How to mitigate cascading failures in API ecosystems?
    Answer: Use circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts, and graceful degradation. Throttle downstream calls, provide fallback responses, and isolate resource pools.
    Explanation: Preventing overload of one component from collapsing the system improves system stability.
    Follow-up: How to test resilience practices?
    Answer: Use chaos engineering tooling to inject failures and validate system behavior.

13. Question: How to secure APIs against common attacks (OWASP top 10)?
    Answer: Input validation, parameterized queries, output encoding, rate limiting, proper auth/authorization, secure headers, secure configurations, logging and monitoring, and scanning. Use SAST/DAST tools.
    Explanation: Addressing OWASP vulnerabilities reduces risk. Keep dependencies updated.
    Follow-up: How to handle third-party library vulnerabilities?
    Answer: Use dependency scanning and enforce patching policies and AB testing for updates.

14. Question: How to design API for data-sensitive or regulated domains (PCI, HIPAA, GDPR)?
    Answer: Encrypt data at rest and in transit, use tokenization for sensitive fields, implement audit trails, minimal data retention, consent management, and role-based access. Use certified hosting and compliant third-party services.
    Explanation: Regulations impose operational and technical controls; design must incorporate them early.
    Follow-up: How to approach data subject deletion under GDPR?
    Answer: Implement deletion workflows with cascading delete/archival and audit logs while preserving compliance for legal hold.

15. Question: How to provide SLAs and SLOs for APIs?
    Answer: Define measurable SLOs (latency p95, availability), monitor via telemetry, and alert when thresholds are breached. Build capacity and redundancy to meet SLAs, and provide consumers with documented SLA terms.
    Explanation: SLO-driven development helps prioritize engineering efforts.
    Follow-up: How to design error budgets?
    Answer: Allocate allowable failure rates to guide release velocity; when budget exhausted, prioritize reliability work.

16. Question: How to design API contracts for multi-team development?
    Answer: Use OpenAPI contract-first approach, generate server/client stubs, enforce contract tests, and maintain a contract registry. Use clear backward-compatibility rules and shared style guides.
    Explanation: Contracts as code reduces integration friction and allows parallel development.
    Follow-up: How to prevent contract drift?
    Answer: Integrate contract checks into CI and automatic compatibility testing.

17. Question: How to handle data migration strategies for APIs?
    Answer: Use additive schema changes, blue/green deployments, dual-write or read-from-both logic during migration, and backfill scripts. Ensure idempotency and checkpoints for large migrations.
    Explanation: Non-disruptive migrations are safer; avoid destructive changes without a rollback plan.
    Follow-up: When to use feature flags in migration?
    Answer: Use flags to toggle new behavior gradually and safely rollback if issues occur.

18. Question: How to implement authentication federation and single sign-on (SSO) for APIs?
    Answer: Use OpenID Connect/OAuth2 with identity providers (Azure AD, Auth0). Implement SSO flows for clients, centralize user management, and propagate claims/tokens across services. Use token exchange when delegation is required.
    Explanation: Federation simplifies user management across domains and partner integrations.
    Follow-up: How to handle multi-tenant identity?
    Answer: Use tenant-aware issuers/scopes and map claims to tenant context.

19. Question: How to manage API lifecycle in CI/CD and deployment?
    Answer: Automate builds, run static analysis, unit/integration/contract tests, publish OpenAPI docs, run security scans, and deploy with blue/green or canary strategies. Automate rollback on failure.
    Explanation: CI/CD reduces human error and speeds up safe delivery.
    Follow-up: How to test backwards compatibility in CI?
    Answer: Run contract/consumer-driven tests against the new build.

20. Question: How to design an API rate-limiting and quota system for paying customers?
    Answer: Implement tiered quotas enforced at API gateway, track usage in a metering service, provide developer portal for keys and usage dashboards, and throttle or bill based on usage. Use distributed counters (Redis) and support burst allowances.
    Explanation: Monetization requires accurate metering, clear quota boundaries, and customer notifications.
    Follow-up: How to avoid race conditions in quota counting?
    Answer: Use atomic Redis operations (INCR, Lua scripts) or transactional counters.

21. Question: How to architect for low-latency APIs globally?
    Answer: Use edge caching via CDN, geo-proximity deployment, read replicas near users, and edge compute (Cloudflare Workers, Lambda\@Edge) for simple logic. Minimize synchronous calls and use async replication for non-critical writes.
    Explanation: Latency-sensitive features benefit from replication and edge caching; design for eventual consistency where possible.
    Follow-up: How to measure and improve tail latency?
    Answer: Monitor p99/p999 latencies, identify hot paths, optimize serialization, and isolate noisy neighbors.

22. Question: How to design APIs to support analytics and data pipelines?
    Answer: Emit structured events for each meaningful API action to an event bus (Kafka, Event Grid). Use schema registry for event contracts and maintain lineage. Separate OLTP and OLAP flows.
    Explanation: Events support downstream analytics, auditing, and asynchronous processing without coupling.
    Follow-up: How to handle schema evolution for events?
    Answer: Use schema registry with backward/forward compatibility rules and versioning for consumers.

23. Question: How to handle API governance across multiple cloud providers?
    Answer: Use cloud-agnostic abstractions, central API management, and CI/CD pipelines that target each provider. Standardize observability and auth across clouds and use Terraform/ARM/Bicep/CloudFormation for infra as code.
    Explanation: Standardization reduces operational overhead and differences between providers.
    Follow-up: How to handle network connectivity between clouds?
    Answer: Use secure VPN or private links, and consider latency and egress costs.

24. Question: How to incorporate privacy by design in APIs?
    Answer: Minimize data collection, anonymize/pseudonymize, require consent, implement data access controls, and ensure secure deletion. Document data flows and provide mechanisms for data export/deletion.
    Explanation: Privacy requirements impact API design choices and data lifecycle.
    Follow-up: How to enable data portability?
    Answer: Provide export endpoints that return user data in structured formats and adhere to privacy regulations.

25. Question: How to transition legacy monolithic APIs to modern microservice APIs with minimal disruption?
    Answer: Use the Strangler Fig pattern—introduce new services for selected functionalities and route traffic gradually from monolith to new services via gateway. Extract shared libraries into common services, implement integration contracts, and perform thorough testing. Keep a rollback plan.
    Explanation: Incremental migration lowers risk and preserves existing clients while enabling new capabilities.
    Follow-up: How to validate correctness during migration?
    Answer: Run A/B or canary traffic, compare responses (shadowing), and use contract tests and production telemetry to detect divergences.

Great, Periasamy — let’s make sure you’re **fully ready** for SQL at an advanced level, with a balance between **hands-on query knowledge** (Tech Lead focus) and **system-level database architecture** (Solution Architect focus).

Here are **25 advanced SQL interview questions with detailed answers, code examples, and follow-up questions**.

---

# **Advanced SQL Interview Preparation (25 Q\&A)**

---

### 1. What is the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`?

**Answer:**

* `INNER JOIN`: Returns matching rows from both tables.
* `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from left, plus matched rows from right.
* `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id;
```

**Follow-up Q:** Which join would you use to find employees with no department?
**A:** `LEFT JOIN` + `WHERE d.Id IS NULL`.

---

### 2. Explain `CROSS APPLY` vs `OUTER APPLY`.

**Answer:**

* `CROSS APPLY`: Works like INNER JOIN with a table-valued function.
* `OUTER APPLY`: Works like LEFT JOIN with a function.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.TopProjects
FROM Employees e
CROSS APPLY dbo.GetTopProjects(e.Id) d;
```

**Follow-up Q:** Why is APPLY better than JOIN sometimes?
**A:** APPLY can pass row values into a function, JOIN cannot.

---

### 3. What is a Common Table Expression (CTE)?

**Answer:**
A temporary result set defined within a query.

**Example:**

```sql
WITH DeptCount AS (
   SELECT DepartmentId, COUNT(*) AS EmpCount
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY DepartmentId
)
SELECT * FROM DeptCount WHERE EmpCount > 10;
```

**Follow-up Q:** How are recursive CTEs useful?
**A:** They help traverse hierarchies like org charts or folder trees.

---

### 4. What are window functions in SQL?

**Answer:**
Functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()` that operate on a window of rows.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT Name, Salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentId ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNum
FROM Employees;
```

**Follow-up Q:** Difference between `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()`?
**A:** `ROW_NUMBER` gives unique numbers; `RANK` allows ties.

---

### 5. What is the difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP`?

**Answer:**

* `DELETE`: Removes rows, can filter, logs each row.
* `TRUNCATE`: Removes all rows, resets identity, minimal logging.
* `DROP`: Deletes the table schema and data.

**Follow-up Q:** Which is faster: DELETE or TRUNCATE?
**A:** TRUNCATE, because it deallocates pages instead of logging row-by-row.

---

### 6. How would you detect and handle deadlocks?

**Answer:**

* SQL Server automatically detects deadlocks and chooses a victim.
* Prevention: consistent ordering of resources, using `SET DEADLOCK_PRIORITY`.

**Follow-up Q:** How do you capture deadlocks in SQL Server?
**A:** Enable deadlock trace flags or use Extended Events.

---

### 7. Explain indexing strategies for high-performance queries.

**Answer:**

* Clustered index: defines physical order of rows.
* Non-clustered index: maintains pointers to data.
* Covering index: includes all required columns.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Employees_Name ON Employees(Name) INCLUDE (DepartmentId);
```

**Follow-up Q:** When should you avoid indexing?
**A:** On small tables or columns with frequent updates.

---

### 8. What is a partitioned table?

**Answer:**
A large table split into smaller partitions based on a column (like Date).

**Follow-up Q:** Why use partitioning?
**A:** Improves query performance and manageability (switch in/out).

---

### 9. Explain normalization and denormalization.

**Answer:**

* Normalization reduces redundancy (3NF, BCNF).
* Denormalization improves read performance by duplicating data.

**Follow-up Q:** For OLAP systems, would you normalize or denormalize?
**A:** Denormalize (star/snowflake schema).

---

### 10. What are ACID properties in databases?

**Answer:**

* Atomicity: All or none.
* Consistency: Data integrity maintained.
* Isolation: Concurrent transactions don’t interfere.
* Durability: Changes persist after commit.

**Follow-up Q:** Which isolation level prevents phantom reads?
**A:** Serializable.

---

### 11. How does `READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT` isolation work?

**Answer:**
It uses row versioning instead of locking, reducing blocking.

**Follow-up Q:** Tradeoff?
**A:** Extra tempdb usage due to row versions.

---

### 12. What are SQL Server Execution Plans?

**Answer:**
They show query execution strategy (seek vs scan).

**Example:**

```sql
SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON;
```

**Follow-up Q:** How do you detect missing indexes from a plan?
**A:** SQL Server suggests them in execution plan warnings.

---

### 13. Difference between `EXISTS` and `IN`.

**Answer:**

* `EXISTS`: Returns true if subquery has rows.
* `IN`: Compares values directly.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Departments d WHERE d.Id = e.DepartmentId);
```

**Follow-up Q:** Which is faster?
**A:** EXISTS in large datasets, because it stops at the first match.

---

### 14. What are table variables vs temp tables?

**Answer:**

* Table variable: Stored in memory, limited stats.
* Temp table: Stored in tempdb, supports indexes/stats.

**Follow-up Q:** Which performs better for large datasets?

**Follow-up Q:** How to find slow queries?
**A:** Use Query Store or sys.dm\_exec\_query\_stats.

---

### 21. Explain difference between clustered and non-clustered index.

**Answer:**

* Clustered: Defines physical row order (only one per table).
* Non-clustered: Logical structure with pointers.

**Follow-up Q:** What happens if no clustered index exists?
**A:** Data is stored as a heap.

---

### 22. What is database federation?

**Answer:**
Splitting data into multiple federated databases for scaling.

**Follow-up Q:** How is it different from partitioning?
**A:** Partitioning is within a single DB, federation spans multiple DBs.

---

### 23. What is SQL Injection and how to prevent it?

**Answer:**
Injection of malicious SQL via inputs. Prevent using parameterized queries and stored procedures.

**Example:**

```csharp
cmd.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = @name";
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", userInput);
```

**Follow-up Q:** Does using ORM prevent SQL Injection?
**A:** Mostly yes, if parameters are used. But dynamic queries still pose risks.

---

### 24. Explain difference between primary key, foreign key, and unique key.

**Answer:**

* Primary key: Uniquely identifies a row.
* Foreign key: Enforces referential integrity.
* Unique key: Ensures uniqueness but allows one NULL.

**Follow-up Q:** Can a table have multiple primary keys?
**A:** No, only one (but it can be composite).

---

### 25. How do you design a high-availability SQL architecture in Azure?

**Answer:**

* **Question + correct answer**
* **Detailed explanation with C# code examples**
* **Follow-up question(s) with answers**

This will make you interview-ready from both **hands-on coding** and **solution architecture perspectives**.

---

# **SOLID Principles Advanced Interview Prep (30 Questions)**

---

## **S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

---

### 1. What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?

**Answer:** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do only one job.

**Example:**

```csharp
// Bad: Handles both user logic and file saving
class UserManager {
    public void AddUser(string name) { /* logic */ }
    public void SaveToFile(User u) { /* file I/O */ }
}

// Good: Split into responsibilities
class UserService { public void AddUser(string name) { /* logic */ } }
class FileRepository { public void Save(User u) { /* file I/O */ } }
```

**Follow-up Q:** How does SRP improve maintainability?
**A:** Changes in file handling won’t affect user logic, reducing ripple effects.

---

### 2. How does SRP apply in solution architecture?

**Answer:** Services, microservices, and APIs should each focus on a single bounded context.

**Example:** In an e-commerce app:

* Order Service handles order processing.
* Payment Service handles transactions.

**Follow-up Q:** What happens if we violate SRP in microservices?
**A:** It creates monolith-like services, harder to scale independently.

---

### 3. Can a class have multiple methods and still follow SRP?

**Answer:** Yes, as long as all methods serve the same responsibility.

**Example:**
A `Logger` class with `LogInfo()`, `LogError()`, `LogDebug()` is still single-responsibility.

**Follow-up Q:** How do you detect SRP violation in large systems?
**A:** Look for classes changing for multiple reasons (business logic + persistence + UI).

---

---

## **O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

---

### 4. What is the Open/Closed Principle?

**Answer:** Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Example:**

```csharp
// Bad
class PaymentProcessor {
    public void Process(string method) {
        if (method == "CreditCard") { /* ... */ }
        else if (method == "Paypal") { /* ... */ }
    }
}

// Good: extend without modifying
interface IPaymentMethod { void Pay(); }
class CreditCard : IPaymentMethod { public void Pay() { } }
class Paypal : IPaymentMethod { public void Pay() { } }

class PaymentProcessor {
    public void Process(IPaymentMethod method) => method.Pay();
}
```

**Follow-up Q:** How does OCP relate to the Strategy Pattern?
**A:** Strategy allows adding new behaviors without modifying existing code.

---

### 5. In solution design, how do APIs apply OCP?

**Answer:** Use versioning. Instead of modifying existing endpoints, add new versions.

**Follow-up Q:** Which API versioning strategy is best for backward compatibility?
**A:** URL-based (e.g., `/api/v2/orders`) or header-based.

---

### 6. How does OCP improve extensibility in microservices?

**Answer:** New functionality can be added by creating new services or plugins without changing core services.

**Follow-up Q:** What’s a downside of overusing OCP?
**A:** Can lead to too many abstractions, making the system harder to understand.

---

---

## **L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

---

### 7. Explain the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).

**Answer:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking functionality.

**Example:**

```csharp
class Bird { public virtual void Fly() { } }
class Sparrow : Bird { public override void Fly() { } }
// Bad
class Ostrich : Bird { public override void Fly() { throw new Exception("Can't fly"); } }
```

**Follow-up Q:** How to fix the above design?
**A:** Create separate abstractions: `IFlyingBird`, `INonFlyingBird`.

---

### 8. How does LSP violation affect architecture?

**Answer:** Causes runtime errors when polymorphism is misused.

**Follow-up Q:** What’s a common LSP violation in service design?

**A:** Services that throw `NotImplementedException` for inherited methods.

---

### 9. Can you give a real-world microservices LSP example?

**Answer:** If a Payment Service implements a base interface, but a specific payment type (e.g., CashOnDelivery) breaks the contract by not supporting refunds.

**Follow-up Q:** How to solve?
**A:** Split into interfaces per responsibility (e.g., `IRefundable`).

---

---

## **I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

---

### 10. What is the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)?

**Answer:** Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

**Example:**

```csharp
// Bad
interface IPrinter {
    void Print();
    void Scan();
    void Fax();
}

// Good
interface IPrinter { void Print(); }
interface IScanner { void Scan(); }
```

**Follow-up Q:** How does ISP reduce coupling?
**A:** Clients only depend on contracts they actually need.

---

### 11. How does ISP apply in microservices?

**Answer:** Services should expose fine-grained APIs.

**Example:** A User Service should not expose Admin-only APIs in the same contract.

**Follow-up Q:** How do you enforce ISP in REST APIs?
**A:** Split APIs by responsibility (e.g., `/users` vs `/admin/users`).

---

### 12. What’s a downside of overusing ISP?

**Answer:** Too many small interfaces can increase complexity.

**Follow-up Q:** How to balance?
**A:** Group related operations, but avoid bloated interfaces.

---

---

## **D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

---

### 13. What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?

**Answer:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

**Example:**

```csharp
// Bad
class Report {
    private FileWriter writer = new FileWriter();
}

// Good
interface IWriter { void Write(string data); }
class FileWriter : IWriter { public void Write(string data) { } }
class Report {
    private IWriter writer;
    public Report(IWriter w) { writer = w; }
}
```

**Follow-up Q:** How do DI containers implement DIP?
**A:** They inject abstractions at runtime, e.g., in .NET Core’s built-in IoC.

---

### 14. How does DIP relate to clean architecture?

**Answer:** Core business logic depends only on interfaces, not infrastructure.

**Follow-up Q:** Where do abstractions live in clean architecture?
**A:** Inside the domain layer. Infrastructure implements them.

---

### 15. How does DIP apply in microservices communication?

**Answer:** Services should depend on contracts (e.g., interfaces, APIs), not on specific service implementations.

**Follow-up Q:** How do you enforce this in Azure Service Bus?
**A:** Define message contracts, not concrete event implementations.

---

---

## **Cross-Principle & Advanced Architecture**

---

### 16. How do SOLID principles help in microservices design?

**Answer:** They guide modularity, decoupling, and scalability.

**Follow-up Q:** Which principle prevents a microservice from doing too much?
**A:** SRP.

---

### 17. Which design patterns embody OCP?

**Answer:** Strategy, Decorator, Factory.

**Follow-up Q:** Which one also helps with DIP?
**A:** Factory pattern, since it creates instances via abstraction.

---

### 18. What’s the connection between SRP and ISP?

**Answer:** SRP applies to classes, ISP applies to interfaces, but both reduce unnecessary responsibilities.

**Follow-up Q:** Can violating ISP lead to SRP violation?
**A:** Yes, because classes may be forced to implement unused methods.

---

### 19. How do SOLID principles improve testability?

**Answer:** By decoupling dependencies (DIP), limiting responsibilities (SRP), and using small contracts (ISP).

**Follow-up Q:** Which principle is most critical for unit testing?
**A:** DIP, because you can inject mocks.

---

### 20. What is a real-world violation of OCP in APIs?

**Answer:** Modifying existing APIs to handle new client types instead of extending via versioning.

**Follow-up Q:** What’s the correct approach?
**A:** Add new endpoints or use polymorphic response models.

---

### 21. How would you apply SOLID in designing a payment gateway?

**Answer:**

* SRP: Split order, payment, notification.
* OCP: Add new payment types without modifying.
* LSP: Ensure all payment types respect refund rules.
* ISP: Separate admin vs user APIs.
* DIP: Payment service depends on IPayment, not concrete types.

**Follow-up Q:** Which SOLID principle helps in scaling this system horizontally?
**A:** SRP and OCP.

---

### 22. Which principle is violated if a class has too many constructor parameters?

**Answer:** SRP and DIP. The class depends on too many responsibilities.

**Follow-up Q:** How to fix?
**A:** Apply Facade or Builder to reduce direct dependencies.

---

### 23. How do SOLID principles relate to Domain-Driven Design (DDD)?

**Answer:** They enforce bounded contexts (SRP), abstractions (DIP), and proper domain models (LSP).

**Follow-up Q:** Which SOLID principle maps to DDD’s anti-corruption layer?
**A:** DIP.

---

### 24. Which SOLID principle directly prevents God Objects?

**Answer:** SRP.

**Follow-up Q:** How to spot a God Object?
**A:** If a class knows too much or does too much (high coupling, low cohesion).

---

### 25. How does SOLID support scalability in cloud-native apps?

**Answer:** Modular, independently deployable, and testable components align with SOLID.

**Follow-up Q:** Which principle is most relevant for scaling APIs?
**A:** OCP, since new functionality is added without breaking existing clients.

---

### 26. Give an example of violating DIP in .NET Core DI.

**Answer:** Registering and injecting concrete types instead of abstractions.

**Follow-up Q:** Fix?
**A:** Always depend on interfaces.

---

### 27. How do SOLID principles reduce technical debt?

**Answer:** They prevent fragile, rigid, and tightly coupled code, making refactoring easier.

**Follow-up Q:** Which principle addresses rigidity the most?
**A:** OCP.

---

### 28. Can SOLID principles conflict with each other?

**Answer:** Yes. Too much OCP can create too many abstractions, violating SRP simplicity.

**Follow-up Q:** How to balance?
**A:** Apply principles pragmatically, not dogmatically.

---

### 29. Which SOLID principle improves security in architecture?

**Answer:** ISP (least privilege contracts) and SRP (separating concerns reduces attack surface).

**Follow-up Q:** Example?
**A:** Separate User API from Admin API instead of mixing.

---

### 30. How would you explain SOLID principles to a non-technical stakeholder?

**Answer:** They ensure software is modular, adaptable, and easier to change without breaking.

**Follow-up Q:** Which analogy fits OCP?
**A:** Like adding a new electrical appliance by plugging into an outlet instead of rewiring the house.

---

Got it, Periasamy 👍. Since you want **20 more SOLID principle questions with a Solution Architect lens**, I’ll focus less on “basic syntax” and more on **system design, microservices, APIs, cloud, security, scalability, and maintainability** — the kind of advanced thinking a Solution Architect is expected to demonstrate.

Here we go:

---

# **20 Advanced SOLID Questions for Solution Architects**

---

## **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

---

### 31. How does SRP guide microservice boundaries?

**Answer:** Each microservice should own a single bounded context, avoiding coupling multiple business domains.

**Example:**

* Order Service handles orders.
* Payment Service handles transactions.

**Follow-up Q:** What happens if a service handles both?
**A:** It violates SRP, creates deployment bottlenecks, and reduces scalability.

---

### 32. How does SRP reduce cloud cost?

**Answer:** By isolating workloads, you can scale only the service that needs extra resources.

**Follow-up Q:** Example?
**A:** If only payment processing needs more throughput, scale Payment Service, not the whole monolith.

---

### 33. How would you apply SRP in designing an Azure Function?

**Answer:** One function should handle one specific responsibility (e.g., "SendEmailOnOrderCreated").

**Follow-up Q:** What if you combine multiple triggers in one function?
**A:** It makes deployment and monitoring harder and breaks SRP.

---

---

## **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

---

### 34. How does OCP apply to API versioning?

**Answer:** Instead of modifying existing endpoints (risking breaking clients), extend by adding `/api/v2/...`.

**Follow-up Q:** Which versioning approach is most scalable?
**A:** URL or header-based versioning.

---

### 35. How does OCP help in cloud-native event-driven systems?

**Answer:** New consumers can subscribe to events without modifying publishers.

**Example:**
An OrderCreated event can be consumed by Billing, Inventory, or Notification services independently.

**Follow-up Q:** What if we modify the event schema often?
**A:** It breaks OCP; instead, extend with new event versions.

---

### 36. What is a real-world architectural OCP example?

**Answer:** Plug-in architecture in enterprise apps: new modules can be added without altering the core.

**Follow-up Q:** Which .NET Core feature supports this?
**A:** Middleware pipeline — you can add new middleware without modifying existing ones.

---

---

## **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

---

### 37. How does LSP violation appear in service contracts?

**Answer:** If a service advertises an interface but throws “Not Supported” exceptions, it violates LSP.

**Follow-up Q:** Solution?
**A:** Define smaller, more accurate contracts (ISP).

---

### 38. How does LSP impact GraphQL or REST APIs?

**Answer:** Subtypes (resources) must fully support their parent contract. If a `PremiumUser` API endpoint omits fields from `User`, it breaks substitution.

**Follow-up Q:** How do you fix?
**A:** Use composition or role-based contracts.

---

### 39. How does LSP help in microservices orchestration?

**Answer:** Services substituting contracts must behave consistently. Otherwise, orchestration flows may fail unexpectedly.

**Follow-up Q:** Example?
**A:** A Refund Service implementing `ITransaction` but rejecting valid inputs would break orchestration.

---

---

## **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

---

### 40. How does ISP influence API design?

**Answer:** Clients should only receive the endpoints they need.

**Follow-up Q:** Example?
**A:** User APIs should not expose admin-only operations.

---

Great — below are **25 interview questions on solution architecture diagrams**, each with:

* A clear **question** and **correct answer**
* A **detailed explanation** and when helpful a small **code/example snippet** (infrastructure as code, Docker, or config)
* An **ASCII diagram** illustrating the architecture concept (plain ASCII only)
* One or more **follow-up question(s)** with a correct answer

These focus on the architecture diagram skillset expected of both a Tech Lead and a Solution Architect: clarity of components, deployment, resiliency, security, data flow, trade-offs, and translating diagrams into implementation artifacts.

---

1. Question: What are the key elements every solution architecture diagram should include?
   Answer: Components (systems/services), relationships (data/control flows), deployment boundaries (on-prem/cloud/zone), external actors, data stores, protocols, and non-functional annotations (SLA, latency, capacity).
   Explanation: Diagrams should be readable at a glance and capture both structure and intent. Use layers (user, API, services, data), label flows with protocols, and add notes for constraints.
   ASCII diagram:

```
[User] --> [API Gateway] --> [Service A] --> [Database]
                  |
                  +--> [Service B] --> [Cache]
```

Code example (commentary): When you translate to IaC, tag resources with "diagram\:ServiceA" and add annotations in Terraform comments.
Follow-up: Which diagram detail do stakeholders usually ask for first?
Answer: Non-functional constraints (availability, RTO/RPO, throughput) and where the system fails over.

---

2. Question: How do you represent high availability and failover in an architecture diagram?
   Answer: Show multiple instances per tier, placement across availability zones or regions, load balancers, and failover paths. Annotate with active/active or active/passive.
   Explanation: HA diagrams must make redundancy and failover explicit so reviewers can validate RPO/RTO.
   ASCII diagram:

```
Region A:        Region B:
[LB-A]           [LB-B]
  |                |
[App-A1][App-A2]  [App-B1][App-B2]
   \      /          \      /
    \____/            \____/
      |                  |
    [DB-Primary] <--> [DB-Replica]
```

Code snippet (Kubernetes, simplified):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: {name: app}
spec:
  replicas: 3
```

Follow-up: Active-active vs active-passive — which lowers failover time?
Answer: Active-active generally has lower failover time because traffic is already served in multiple locations; active-passive requires promotion.

---

3. Question: How to depict network segregation and security zones in diagrams?
   Answer: Use bordered zones labeled (e.g., Internet, DMZ, Private Subnet), place components inside zones and show controlled ingress/egress via gateways/firewalls.
   Explanation: Security diagrams must show trust boundaries and where controls (WAF, NSG, VPN) are applied.
   ASCII diagram:

```
[Internet]
    |
  [WAF]
    |
[DMZ] ----[VPN Gateway]--- [OnPrem Network]
  |
[App Subnet - Private] -> [DB Subnet]
```

Code example (Azure NSG snippet):

```hcl
resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "nsg" {
  name = "app-nsg"
  security_rule { name = "allow_app" protocol = "Tcp" ... }
}
```

Follow-up: Where should secrets be placed relative to security zones?
Answer: Secrets should be in a secure vault (e.g., Key Vault) reachable only from private subnets and authenticated via managed identity.

---

4. Question: How do you represent asynchronous messaging and eventual consistency in diagrams?
   Answer: Use message broker icons (queue/topic) and arrows showing asynchronous flows. Label with semantics (at-least-once, exactly-once). Add notes about eventual consistency.
   Explanation: Asynchronous systems decouple services; diagrams must show producers, broker, consumers, and compensation patterns.
   ASCII diagram:

```
[Service A] --(push)-> [Queue/Topic]
                       /         \
             (pull) [Worker 1]  [Worker 2]
```

Code example (pseudo):

```csharp
// publish
await topicClient.PublishAsync(new OrderCreated { OrderId = id });
```

Follow-up: How does eventual consistency affect client UI?
Answer: UI should present eventual states (show "processing"), or use read-after-write patterns like read-your-writes or transient caching.

---

5. Question: How to show data flow for a request that touches several microservices?
   Answer: Use a sequence diagram or flow arrows across component boxes with numbered steps. Annotate with data shape or size where relevant.
   Explanation: Sequence diagrams make latency and synchronous vs asynchronous calls explicit.
   ASCII diagram:

```
[User]->1 [API GW]->2 [Auth]->3 [OrderService]->4 [Inventory]->5 [Payment]
```

Code example (OpenAPI path):

```yaml
paths:
  /orders:
    post:
      operationId: createOrder
```

Follow-up: When should you prefer sync over async in the sequence?
Answer: Prefer sync for operations requiring immediate consistency or user-facing latency requirements; prefer async for long-running or decoupled tasks.

---

6. Question: How to diagram database sharding or partitioning strategy?
   Answer: Show shards as separate database boxes, mapping function (e.g., tenantId % N), and a routing layer that decides which shard to hit.
   Explanation: Illustrate where routing happens (app vs proxy), the shard key, and re-sharding strategy.
   ASCII diagram:

```
[App Server] -> [Shard Router] -> [DB Shard 1]
                               -> [DB Shard 2]
                               -> [DB Shard N]
```

Code example (router logic pseudo):

```csharp
int shard = tenantId % shardCount;
db = GetDbForShard(shard);
```

Follow-up: What are common challenges with sharding?
Answer: Cross-shard joins, re-sharding complexity, transactional consistency across shards.

---

7. Question: How do you show caching layers in a diagram and placement strategies?
   Answer: Show cache boxes (edge CDN, reverse proxy, in-memory, distributed) near clients or services and label cache keys/ttl.
   Explanation: Diagrams should indicate what is cached (static assets vs computed results) and invalidation signals.
   ASCII diagram:

```
[User] -> [CDN] -> [API Gateway] -> [App] -> [Redis Cache] -> [DB]
```

Code example (Redis usage):

```csharp
var val = await cache.GetStringAsync(key);
if (val == null) {
  val = await db.QueryAsync(sql);
  await cache.SetStringAsync(key, val, ttl);
}
```

Follow-up: Where do you place the cache for read-heavy traffic?
Answer: Use CDN at the edge for static content and distributed cache (Redis) close to app tier for dynamic data.

---

8. Question: How to diagram CI/CD pipeline and deployment flow?
   Answer: Show source control, build, test, artifact registry, staging, and production with deployment strategies (blue/green, canary).
   Explanation: Important to illustrate gating (automated tests, manual approvals) and rollback paths.
   ASCII diagram:

```
[Git] -> [CI Build] -> [Tests] -> [Artifact Repo] -> [CD -> Staging]
                                |-> [Manual Approval] -> [Prod Canary -> Prod]
```

Code snippet (GitHub Actions job snippet):

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [checkout, build, test, publish]
```

Follow-up: When should you use blue/green vs canary?
Answer: Use blue/green for quick rollback with identical infra; canary for gradual exposure and safety on traffic-sensitive changes.

---

9. Question: How to depict multi-tenant architecture options in diagrams?
   Answer: Show three options: shared schema, shared database with tenantId; separate schema per tenant; separate database per tenant. Diagram each with the tenant routing layer.
   Explanation: Diagrams should include pros/cons: cost vs isolation.
   ASCII diagram (shared DB):

```
[App] -> [DB: tenants table (tenantId)] -> [Rows for tenant A, B, C]
```

ASCII diagram (separate DBs):

```
[App] -> Tenant Router -> [DB-TenantA]
                          [DB-TenantB]
```

Follow-up: Which multi-tenancy model offers best isolation?
Answer: Separate database per tenant; highest isolation but higher operational cost.

---

10. Question: How to show external integrations (third-party APIs) and their reliability implications?
    Answer: Show external systems as separate boxes with labeled SLAs and link them with retry/backoff and timeout semantics. Add circuit breaker symbol.
    Explanation: Diagram must highlight dependencies and mitigation: caching, fallbacks, retries.
    ASCII diagram:

```
[App] -> [3rdParty API (SLA 99.5%)]
   |-> [Cache]
   |-> [Fallback Service]
```

Code example (Polly in .NET):

```csharp
policy = Policy.Handle<Exception>().RetryAsync(3);
await policy.ExecuteAsync(() => client.CallAsync());
```

Follow-up: What diagram annotation shows that an external service is unreliable?
Answer: Annotate with "SLA", "p99 latency", and show circuit breaker/fallback and cache.

---

11. Question: How would you diagram a data pipeline for analytics (ETL/ELT)?
    Answer: Show data producers, streaming or batch ingestion, staging storage (blob), transformation compute (Databricks/Glue), and data warehouse / OLAP. Include schema registry and event bus.
    Explanation: Distinguish between real-time (streaming) and batch lanes. Add retention and partition notes.
    ASCII diagram:

```
[App Events] -> [Event Hub] -> [Stream Processor] -> [Data Lake]
                                   |
                                   v
                             [Data Warehouse]
```

Code snippet (Spark pseudocode):

```python
df = spark.readStream.format("kafka").load()
df.write.format("parquet").save("/data/lake")
```

Follow-up: Why include a schema registry in the diagram?
Answer: To manage event schema evolution and ensure compatibility across producers/consumers.

---

12. Question: How to show identity and authentication flows in a diagram?
    Answer: Diagram the identity provider, tokens (JWT), token validation at API gateway, and scopes/roles. Show MFA or SSO flows if applicable.
    Explanation: Make token exchange and refresh flows explicit and where secrets/keys live.
    ASCII diagram:

```
[User] -> [Auth Server] -> (JWT) -> [API Gateway] -> [Service]
                 ^                         |
                 |-------------------------|
```

Code example (JWT validation middleware):

```csharp
services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme).AddJwtBearer(...);
```

Follow-up: Where do you store public keys used to validate tokens?
Answer: In the API gateway or service cache; regularly refresh from JWKS endpoint.

---

13. Question: How to diagram data encryption at rest and in-flight?
    Answer: Use labels on storage boxes (encrypted at rest) and on links (TLS). Show key management (Key Vault).
    Explanation: Diagrams should clarify encryption ownership (customer-managed keys vs provider-managed).
    ASCII diagram:

```
[Service] --(TLS)--> [DB (Encrypted at rest)]
                       |
                  [Key Vault (CMK)]
