    - Show middleware, filters, and exception handling patterns.

32. **Retry Pattern**
    - "How would you implement retry logic for external API calls?"
    - Show exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns.

33. **Validation Patterns**
    - "How would you implement input validation that's reusable and maintainable?"
    - Show model validation, custom attributes, and FluentValidation.

### **Security Patterns**
34. **Authentication & Authorization**
    - "How would you implement JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization?"

    - "How would you design a Web API that serves multiple tenants with data isolation?"
    - Show tenant identification, data separation strategies, and configuration.

40. **API Gateway Pattern**
    - "How would you implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and rate limiting across multiple APIs?"
    - Show gateway implementation and service orchestration.

## **FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS (Expect These After Your Initial Answer)**

- **"How would you test this pattern?"**
- **"What are the disadvantages of this approach?"**
- **"How would this scale with increased load?"**
- **"How would you handle failures in this design?"**
- **"What metrics would you monitor for this implementation?"**
- **"How would you migrate from the old design to this new one?"**
- **"What are the performance implications?"**
- **"How does this pattern affect maintainability?"**

## **KEY SUCCESS TIPS**

1. **Always start with the problem** the pattern/principle solves
2. **Show concrete code examples** (10-15 lines max)
3. **Discuss trade-offs** - every pattern has pros and cons
4. **Connect to business value** - how does it help the organization?
5. **Mention testing strategy** for each pattern you discuss
6. **Be ready to critique your own design** and suggest improvements
