I’m a software developer with over 16 years of experience. I began my career with FoxPro, then worked with VB6 and other languages, and transitioned to .NET around 12 years ago. I’m currently seeking a job change, aiming for roles such as Fullstack Lead Developer, Technical Architect, or Solution Architect. My goal is to move into modern technologies like .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, Web API, Microservices, Azure and React JS.

However, my knowledge in these areas—especially React JS — is currently limited, which is making it difficult to clear technical interviews for senior roles. I want to focus on one topic at a time, starting with **React JS**.

Please provide:

1. A list of common **React JS interview questions** for senior roles (Lead, Architect).
2. A **detailed study plan** to learn React JS thoroughly and prepare for interviews, including concepts, best practices, architecture patterns, and hands-on skills.

Make a study plan for learning **React JS**, in which list the sections / topics to cover.

- Explain state management patterns and when to use local vs global state

**Advanced React Patterns:**
- Implement higher-order components (HOCs) vs render props vs custom hooks
- Explain compound components pattern and when to use it
- How would you implement error boundaries and why are they important?
- Describe code splitting and lazy loading strategies
- What are React portals and their use cases?

**Performance & Optimization:**
- How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders in React applications?
- Explain React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback with practical examples
- What strategies would you use for optimizing large lists?
- How do you handle memory leaks in React applications?
- Describe bundle optimization techniques for React apps

**Architecture & Best Practices:**
- How would you structure a large-scale React application?
- Explain different state management solutions (Redux, Zustand, Context API) and when to use each
- How do you handle API calls and async operations in React?
- Describe testing strategies for React components and applications
- What are your approaches to handling forms and validation?

**Integration & Ecosystem:**
- How would you integrate React with existing .NET APIs?
- Explain server-side rendering (SSR) vs client-side rendering (CSR)
- How do you handle authentication and authorization in React apps?
- Describe your approach to styling in React applications
- What build tools and development workflows do you prefer?

## Detailed React JS Study Plan

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**

*React Fundamentals*
Start with understanding React's core philosophy and basic concepts. Learn about components, JSX syntax, and the virtual DOM. Practice creating functional components and understanding how React renders elements. Focus on props, state, and basic event handling.

*Modern JavaScript Prerequisites*
Since React heavily uses ES6+ features, ensure you're comfortable with arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, modules, promises, and async/await. These are essential for writing modern React code.

*Development Environment Setup*
Set up your development environment with Node.js, npm/yarn, and create-react-app. Learn about the project structure and basic tooling. Understand how to use browser developer tools for React debugging.

**Phase 2: Core React Concepts (Weeks 3-4)**

*Hooks Deep Dive*
Master useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback, and useRef. Understand when and why to use each hook. Practice building custom hooks for reusable logic.

*Component Patterns*
Learn about composition vs inheritance in React, controlled vs uncontrolled components, and lifting state up. Understand when to break components into smaller pieces and how to design component APIs.

*Event Handling and Forms*
Master form handling, validation, and different input types. Learn about synthetic events and how React handles event delegation. Practice building complex forms with proper validation.

**Phase 3: State Management (Weeks 5-6)**

*Context API*
Understand React Context for sharing state across components without prop drilling. Learn when Context is appropriate and its limitations for complex state management.

*Redux Fundamentals*
Learn Redux principles, actions, reducers, and store. Understand how Redux works with React through react-redux. Practice building applications with Redux for global state management.

*Modern State Management*
Explore alternatives like Zustand or Jotai for simpler state management solutions. Understand the trade-offs between different state management approaches.

**Phase 4: Advanced Patterns (Weeks 7-8)**

*Performance Optimization*
Learn about React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback for preventing unnecessary re-renders. Understand React Profiler and how to identify performance bottlenecks. Practice optimizing component rendering.

*Advanced Component Patterns*
Master render props, higher-order components, and compound components. Learn about error boundaries and how to handle errors gracefully in React applications.

*Code Splitting and Lazy Loading*
Understand React.lazy, Suspense, and dynamic imports. Learn how to implement route-based and component-based code splitting for better performance.

**Phase 5: Real-World Application (Weeks 9-10)**

*Routing and Navigation*
Master React Router for single-page application navigation. Learn about nested routes, route guards, and programmatic navigation. Understand how to handle authentication flows.

*API Integration*
Learn best practices for making HTTP requests in React applications. Understand how to handle loading states, error states, and caching. Practice with libraries like Axios or the fetch API.

*Testing Strategies*
Learn unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library. Understand how to test components, hooks, and user interactions. Practice writing integration tests and end-to-end tests.

**Phase 6: Production Readiness (Weeks 11-12)**

*Build and Deployment*
Understand webpack configuration, environment variables, and production optimizations. Learn about different deployment strategies and CI/CD pipelines for React applications.

*Styling Solutions*
Explore different styling approaches including CSS modules, styled-components, and CSS-in-JS solutions. Understand how to create maintainable and scalable styling architectures.

*Security and Best Practices*
Learn about common security vulnerabilities in React applications and how to prevent them. Understand accessibility best practices and how to build inclusive user interfaces.

## Hands-On Project Recommendations

Build a comprehensive project that demonstrates your skills, such as a task management application with user authentication, real-time updates, and integration with your .NET backend APIs. This will give you practical experience and something concrete to discuss in interviews.

Focus on implementing features like user registration/login, CRUD operations, search and filtering, responsive design, and proper error handling. This project will help you understand how all the concepts work together in a real application.

Given your .NET background, you'll likely find React's component-based architecture familiar, similar to how you might structure classes and modules in .NET. The key is understanding React's declarative nature and how data flows through components.
