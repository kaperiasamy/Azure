# SQL - Temporary Tables

## Definition of Temporary Tables

- **What Are Temp Tables**: Temporary tables are special types of tables that are stored in the databaseâ€™s temporary storage. They are useful for storing intermediate results, facilitating complex queries, and improving performance in applications involving large data sets or complex transactions.
- **Scope**: They exist in a session (local temp tables) or globally across all sessions (global temp tables) and are automatically dropped when the session ends or the connection is closed.

## Creating Temporary Tables

**Syntax**: Use the CREATE TABLE statement with a # prefix for local temp tables and ## for global temp tables.

```sql
-- Local Temporary Table
CREATE TABLE #TempTable (
    Id INT,
    Name NVARCHAR(100)
);

-- Global Temporary Table
CREATE TABLE ##GlobalTempTable (
    Id INT,
    Description NVARCHAR(255)
);

```

1. **Local Temp Table**: Accessible only to the session that created it. It automatically drops when the connection is closed.
2. **Global Temp Table**: Accessible across all sessions, dropping after the last session referencing it closes.

## Dropping Temporary Tables
- **Automatic Dropping**: Emphasize that temp tables are automatically dropped at the end of the session, but you can explicitly drop them using the following syntax:

```sql
DROP TABLE #TempTable;
DROP TABLE ##GlobalTempTable;
```

- **Best Practice**: Always explicitly drop temporary tables in your scripts or stored procedures to ensure resources are freed up immediately, which is particularly helpful in long-running processes.

## Best Practices

- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for temporary tables, possibly including a module or operation identifier to make understanding the purpose easier later.
- **Performance**: While temporary tables can improve performance by managing datasets, they use tempdb resources, so limit their use to necessary operations. Consider alternatives like table variables for smaller data sets.
- **Indexes**: For large temp tables, consider creating indexes to enhance query performance. Although they consume additional space in tempdb, they can greatly improve lookup times.

## Use Cases

- **Complex Queries**: Use temp tables to store intermediate results when performing complex calculations or joins that might otherwise require large result sets in memory.
- **Data Manipulation**: Great for scenarios involving batch processing or data transformations where results are needed before final insertions into permanent tables.
