# Reverse Proxy

## Definition of Reverse Proxy

    A Reverse Proxy is a type of server that sits between client devices and web servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend server. Unlike a traditional forward proxy that acts on behalf of clients, a reverse proxy acts on behalf of servers, handling incoming requests from clients and directing them to the appropriate server resources.

## How it Works

    - **When a client sends a request**:
        - The request is sent to the reverse proxy server instead of directly to the web server.
        - The reverse proxy evaluates the request and determines which backend server should handle it.
        - It forwards the request to the selected backend server.
        - Once the backend server processes the request, the response is sent back to the reverse proxy, which then sends it to the client.

## Use Cases for Reverse Proxy

    - **Load Balancing**:
        Reverse proxies can distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overloaded, thus enhancing performance and availability.

    - **SSL Termination**:
        They can manage SSL encryption and decryption, reducing the computational load on backend servers. By handling SSL at the proxy level, backend servers can focus on processing application logic and database operations.

    - **Caching**:
        Reverse proxies can cache responses from backend servers, which improves performance by serving cached content to clients without hitting the backend each time.

    - **Security**:
        They add an additional layer of security by hiding the identity of backend servers. Reverse proxies can also enforce security policies, block malicious requests, and mitigate threats such as DDoS attacks.

    - **Compression**:
        Reverse proxies can compress outbound content before sending it to clients, reducing bandwidth usage and improving load times for end-users.

## Examples of Reverse Proxy Servers

- **Nginx**: Widely used for both load balancing and as a reverse proxy server. It efficiently handles a large number of concurrent connections.
- **Apache HTTP Server**: Configured as a reverse proxy using the mod_proxy module.
- **Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)**: Can function as a reverse proxy through the Application Request Routing (ARR) module.

## Implementation Example in .NET Environment

    In a .NET application, you might set up a reverse proxy using Nginx in front of an ASP.NET Core application:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name yourdomain.com;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;  # Forward requests to the ASP.NET Core app
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```
