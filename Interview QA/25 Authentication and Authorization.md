# Authentication and Authorization in Web API

## Definitions:
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. This ensures that users are who they claim to be before granting them access to resources. In a web API context, this typically involves validating credentials such as usernames and passwords, tokens, or certificates.
- Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining whether the authenticated user has permission to access specific resources or perform certain actions. This is often based on user roles and permissions defined in the application.

## Differences Between Authentication and Authorization:
- Authentication answers the question: Who are you?
- Authorization answers the question: What can you do?

Both processes are crucial for securing APIs, but they serve different purposes and occur at different stages in the access control process.

## Common Authentication Strategies in Web APIs:
- **Basic Authentication**: Uses HTTP headers to send credentials (username and password) encoded in Base64. It’s simple but not secure over plain HTTP; always use it over HTTPS.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: This uses tokens (e.g., JSON Web Tokens - JWT) that clients receive upon successful authentication. These tokens are then included in the HTTP headers for subsequent requests, allowing for stateless authentication. In .NET, this can be achieved using middleware like Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.
- **OAuth**: An open standard for access delegation commonly used as a way to grant access to APIs. OAuth allows third-party applications to access user data without sharing credentials, primarily using tokens. It’s often used in scenarios involving external identity providers (like Google, Facebook).

## Common Authorization Strategies in Web APIs:
- **Role-Based Authorization**: This approach grants access based on user roles assigned within the application (e.g., Admin, User). In .NET, you can use [Authorize] attributes to enforce role-based access at the controller or action level.
- **Claims-Based Authorization**: Instead of roles, this method uses claims (additional information about the user, like permissions, department, etc.) to make authorization decisions. Claims allow more granular control compared to roles.
- **Policy-Based Authorization**: You can define policies that group several requirements together. This is powerful for defining complex access rules tailored to specific business logic.

## Example Implementation in .NET:
Here’s a brief example of implementing JWT authentication in an ASP.NET Core API:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .AddJwtBearer(options =>
        {
            options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
            {
                ValidateIssuer = true,
                ValidateAudience = true,
                ValidateLifetime = true,
                ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
                ValidIssuer = "YourIssuer",
                ValidAudience = "YourAudience",
                IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSecretKey"))
            };
        });
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("AdminOnly", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
    });
    services.AddControllers();
}
```
In this example, JWT authentication is configured along with a role-based policy for the admin role. You would apply the authorization policy as follows:

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]
public IActionResult GetAdminData()
{
    // Only accessible by users in the Admin role.
}
```

## Conclusion: 
By providing clear definitions of authentication and authorization, outlining the differences between them, detailing common strategies for implementing each within a web API, and presenting practical examples, you demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of securing web applications. Additionally, you may want to prepare for follow-up questions that might cover scenarios involving API security best practices, handling token expiration, or differences between OAuth and OpenID Connect. This thorough preparation will enhance your credibility as an expert in API security.

Authentication and Authorization are two essential concepts in securing applications, particularly in .NET Core applications. Here’s a detailed explanation you can provide in an interview to showcase your expertise while minimizing follow-up questions:

## Authentication in .NET Core:

**Definition**: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or application. It ensures that the entities requesting access are who they claim to be.

### Mechanisms in .NET Core:
- **Cookies**: Implements cookie-based authentication, which stores an authentication cookie in the user’s browser. This is often used for web applications where users log in and remain authenticated across requests.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Utilizes token-based authentication, providing a stateless way of authenticating users. JWTs are commonly used in APIs, where a server issues a token upon successful authentication, which the client includes in subsequent requests.
**Implementation Examples**:

#### Cookie Authentication:

```csharp
services.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =>
{
    options.LoginPath = "/Account/Login";
    options.LogoutPath = "/Account/Logout";
    options.AccessDeniedPath = "/Account/AccessDenied";
});
```
#### JWT Authentication:

```csharp
services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddJwtBearer(options =>
    {
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            ValidateIssuer = true,
            ValidateAudience = true,
            ValidateLifetime = true,
            ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
            // Add your issuer, audience, and signing key here
        };
    });
```
## Authorization in .NET Core:

**Definition**: Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has permission to access specific resources or perform specific actions after they have been authenticated.
### Mechanisms in .NET Core:
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Checks if a user belongs to a specific role (e.g., Admin, User) to grant or deny access to resources or actions based on these roles. Roles are typically defined in the application’s user management logic.
- **Policy-Based Authorization**: Provides a more granular control mechanism that uses policies defined based on custom requirements. Policies can include multiple checks and criteria beyond simple role memberships.
**Implementation Examples**:
#### Role-Based Authorization:

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public IActionResult AdminPanel()
{
    // Only accessible to users in the Admin role
    return View();
}
```
#### Policy-Based Authorization:

```csharp
services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("RequireAdminRole", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
});
```
#### Applying a policy:

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdminRole")]
public IActionResult AdminOnly()
{
    return View();
}
```
## Key Differences:

Authentication is about validating the identity of a user, while Authorization is about determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
