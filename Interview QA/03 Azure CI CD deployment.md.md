# Azure CI CD deployment

## Definition of CI/CD

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: A development practice where code changes are automatically tested and merged into a shared repository multiple times a day, ensuring early detection of defects.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)**: The practice of automatically deploying code changes to production or staging environments after they pass through automated tests.

## Azure CI/CD Overview

- **Azure DevOps**: The primary platform for implementing CI/CD in Azure, which provides a set of development tools for planning, developing, delivering, and monitoring applications.

## Key Components of Azure CI/CD

- **Azure Repos**: Git repositories to manage your source code.
- **Azure Pipelines**: The service for building and deploying applications. Supports various languages and cloud platforms.
- **Azure Artifacts**: For hosting and sharing packages and dependencies. It manages versioning, access, and retention policies.
- **Azure Test Plans**: For testing your applications and collecting feedback throughout the process.

## CI/CD Pipeline Steps

- **Build Pipeline**: Automate the process of compiling code, running tests, and creating build artifacts.
    - Set up a pipeline in Azure DevOps that triggers on code commits or pull requests.
    - Integrate automated testing frameworks to ensure code quality with tools like MSTest, xUnit, or NUnit.

- **Release Pipeline**: Automate the deployment of build artifacts to one or more environments (staging, production).
    - Define release stages for different environments.
    - Use approval gates for production deployments to add checks and balances.

## Deployment Strategies

- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Maintain two identical production environments, switch traffic between them, reducing downtime.
- **Canary Releases**: Deploy features to a small subset of users before a broader rollout, allowing testing in production.

## Best Practices

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use tools like Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **Monitor and Feedback**: Integrate monitoring (e.g., Azure Monitor, Application Insights) to collect telemetry and use it for continuous improvement.
- **Security Practices**: Follow DevSecOps principles by integrating security checks within the CI/CD pipeline, such as static code analysis and vulnerability scanning.

## Conclusion

> Emphasize that with your extensive experience, you understand how to leverage Azure CI/CD to ensure high-quality software delivery while optimizing deployment processes, minimizing risks, and enhancing collaboration between development and operations teams.
