# Async/Await in DotNet core

## Explanation of Async/Await in .NET Core:

**Definition**: The Async/Await keywords are used to work with asynchronous programming in .NET Core. The async keyword enables the await keyword in the method, indicating that the method can perform asynchronous operations.
**Purpose**: The primary purpose of using Async/Await is to improve the performance of applications by allowing tasks to run concurrently, freeing up the main thread to continue processing other requests while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

## Key Concepts:

### Async Method:
An async method is defined with the async modifier and returns a Task or Task<T>. It uses the await keyword to mark points in the method where execution can be paused until the awaited task is complete.
Example:

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    using (var client = new HttpClient())
    {
        var response = await client.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
        return response;
    }
}
```
### Await Keyword:
The await keyword is used before a call to an asynchronous method. It tells the compiler to pause execution of the method until the awaited task is completed. Control is returned to the calling method, allowing other operations to operate during the wait.
**Behavior**: When the task being awaited completes, execution resumes at the point of the await in the original method.

### Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP):
- The Async/Await pattern follows the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern, which unifies various asynchronous operations into a consistent model based on the Task class.
- TAP allows for better scalability and easier error handling with the try-catch blocks, as exceptions can be captured and managed seamlessly.

### Benefits of Async/Await:

- **Improved Responsiveness**: Applications remain responsive while waiting for I/O operations to complete. This is particularly valuable in UI applications where freezing can degrade user experience.
- **Simplified Code**: Asynchronous code can be more readable and maintainable compared to using traditional asynchronous patterns like callbacks or event handlers. It resembles synchronous code, making it easier to follow.
- **Scalability**: Async methods allow for better resource management and higher scalability in web applications since threads can process other requests while waiting for operations to complete, optimizing server resource utilization.

### Considerations:

  - **Context Switching**: Be aware that excessive use of async operations can lead to context switching overhead, which may impact performance. Use async judiciously in CPU-bound operations.
  - **Deadlock Risks**: Ensure to use async/await correctly to avoid deadlocks, especially when calling async methods from synchronous contexts.
