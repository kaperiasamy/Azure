# Microservices

## What are Microservices?

**Definition**: Microservices are small, self-contained units of software that perform discrete functions. They interact with one another through well-defined APIs, often using lightweight communication protocols such as HTTP or messaging queues.

## Why We Need Microservices?

- **Scalability**: Each microservice can be scaled independently. If one service experiences high demand, you can scale it without affecting other services.
- **Fault Isolation**: If one microservice fails, it will not necessarily take down the entire application, enhancing overall system resilience.
- **Faster Time to Market**: Teams can develop, deploy, and update microservices independently, enabling a more agile development cycle.
- **Technology Diversity**: Microservices allow the use of different technology stacks or programming languages appropriate for specific service functionalities.

## When to Use Microservices?

- **Large-scale Applications**: When developing a complex application with multiple functionalities.
- **Rapid Development Needs**: In teams practicing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
= **Frequent Updates**: If your application requires frequent updates and you want to minimize the impact of changes.
- **Distributed Teams**: When working with distributed teams that can develop services in parallel.

## Advantages Over Other Architectures:

- **Monolithic Architecture**: In a monolith, all components are interconnected and can lead to tight coupling, making it hard to scale and manage. Microservices allow for loose coupling.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: While SOA focuses on reusability of services and often involves heavyweight protocols, microservices emphasize lightweight communication and independent scaling.

## Design Patterns in Microservices:

Some of the common design patterns used in microservices include:

- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for clients to interact with multiple microservices. It handles requests, routing, and offers features like authentication and logging.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents a microservice from repeatedly making calls to a failing service and gives it time to recover.
- **Service Discovery**: Manages how services find each other, either through client-side discovery or server-side discovery (e.g., using tools like Consul or Eureka).
- **Event Sourcing**: Stores the state of a service as a sequence of events which allows for traceability and easy rebuilding of state.
- **Strangling Pattern**: Gradually replacing parts of a monolithic application with microservices by redirecting traffic to the new service.

## Conclusion:

Overall, microservices architecture promotes modularity and agility in development, leading to more resilient and adaptable systems.

## Summary of Key Differences:

- **Coupling and Independence**: Microservices provide greater autonomy for each component, reducing the risk of changes impacting other services, while monolithic systems are tightly coupled.
- **Scalability Challenges**: Microservices enable precise scaling, focusing only on parts of the application that require it, unlike monoliths which necessitate scaling the entire application.
- **Deployment Efficiency**: Microservices can be deployed and iterated on individually, providing faster development cycles compared to the more cumbersome deployment of monolithic applications or even SOA, which may face issues during service integration.
- **Technological Flexibility**: Developers can use the best-suited technology for each microservice, making the architecture more adaptable to changing needs, a luxury more limited in traditional monolithic and often fixed in SOA architectures.

## Design patterns

1. **API Gateway Pattern**

**Description**: An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for clients to interact with multiple microservices. It handles routing, composition, and protocol translation.
**Benefits**: Simplifies client interactions, offloads responsibilities such as authentication and logging, and provides a central point for monitoring and analytics.
**Example code**:
```csharp
// ASP.NET Core API Gateway implementation
public class ApiGatewayStartup {
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
        services.AddOcelot(); // Ocelot is a popular API Gateway
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) {
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
        app.UseOcelot().Wait(); // Redirects requests to the appropriate microservice
    }
}

```
**Explanation**:

In this example, Ocelot is used as the API Gateway. It handles requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices based on the configuration provided in a `configuration.json` file. The gateway simplifies client interactions and centralizes access control, logging, and monitoring.

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**

**Description**: This pattern prevents repeated calls to a service that is likely to fail, allowing it to recover without overwhelming the system.
**Benefits**: Enhances system resilience by managing failures gracefully and improving overall reliability. It can monitor requests and, after a timeout, allow requests to pass again only if the service shows signs of recovery.
**Example code**:
```csharp
public class WeatherService {
    private readonly IAsyncPolicy<WeatherResponse> _circuitBreakerPolicy;

    public WeatherService() {
        _circuitBreakerPolicy = Policy.Handle<HttpRequestException>()
            .CircuitBreakerAsync(2, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)); 
            // Break the circuit after 2 failures
    }

    public async Task<WeatherResponse> GetWeatherAsync(string city) {
        return await _circuitBreakerPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () => {
            // Call to external weather API
        });
    }
}
```
**Explanation**:

This example uses **Polly**, a resilience and transient-fault-handling library. The circuit breaker will allow a maximum of 2 failures within a defined duration, after which it will stop making calls to the service for a minute, preventing further strain on the failing service.

3. **Service Discovery Pattern**

**Description**: Manages how microservices find each other without hardcoding URLs. Service discovery can be client-side (the service itself finds other services) or server-side (a centralized server keeps track of available services).
**Benefits**: Enables dynamic scaling and easier management of microservices, simplifying interactions between services that may change location frequently.
**Example code**:
```csharp
public class Startup {
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
        services.AddConsul(); // Using Consul for Service Discovery
    }
}

// In your microservice, register it with Consul
public void RegisterWithConsul(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) {
    var consulClient = serviceProvider.GetService<IConsulClient>();
    var serviceId = "weather-service-1";

    consulClient.Agent.ServiceRegister(new AgentServiceRegistration {
        ID = serviceId,
        Service = "WeatherService",
        Address = "localhost",
        Port = 5000,
        Tags = new[] { "weather" }
    });
}
```
**Explanation**:

In this example, **Consul** is used for service discovery. Microservices register themselves with the Consul agent, making them discoverable by other services. When another microservice needs to invoke the Weather Service, it queries Consul to find its location.

4. **Event Sourcing Pattern**

**Description**: Instead of just storing the current state of a service, this pattern captures state changes as a sequence of events. Each change is recorded, making it possible to rebuild the state by replaying these events.
**Benefits**: Supports traceability of changes, offers a historical log for auditing purposes, and allows easier recovery from failures.
**Example Code**:
```csharp
public class EventStore {
    private readonly List<string> _events = new List<string>();

    public void SaveEvent(string eventInfo) {
        _events.Add(eventInfo); // Save event to the store
    }

    public IEnumerable<string> GetEvents() {
        return _events; // Replay events to recreate state
    }
}
```
**Explanation**:

This code snippet illustrates a simple event store where each event is saved. The `GetEvents` method allows you to replay these events to restore or construct application state, supporting traceability and rebuilding of state for your microservices.

5. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern**

**Description**: Separates read and write operations into different models. Commands make changes to the data, while queries read data from the database.
**Benefits**: Enhances performance, allows independent optimization of read and write operations, and can simplify complex business logic, especially in scalable systems.
**Example code**:
```csharp
// Command Object
public class CreateUserCommand {
    public string UserName { get; set; }
}

// Command Handler
public class CreateUserCommandHandler {
    public void Handle(CreateUserCommand command) {
        // Logic to create a new user
    }
}

// Query Object
public class GetUserQuery {
    public string UserId { get; set; }
}

// Query Handler
public class GetUserQueryHandler {
    public User Handle(GetUserQuery query) {
        // Logic to return user details
    }
}
```
**Explanation**:

Here, separate classes for commands and queries showcase CQRS. Commands modify data while queries retrieve data, allowing different optimizations and scaling strategies for read and write operations, respectively.

6. **Strangle Pattern**

**Description**: Gradually replaces parts of an existing monolithic application with microservices by routing requests from the monolith to the new microservices over time.
**Benefits**: Allows incremental migration to microservices without requiring a full rewrite, reducing risk and spreading costs over time.
**Example code**:
```csharp
public class LegacyController : Controller {
    public IActionResult GetRequest(int id) {
        var response = // call new microservice;  
        if (response.Success) {
            return response;
        } else {
            // Fallback to legacy logic
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation**:

As you gradually migrate from a monolithic to a microservices architecture, routes can be selectively routed to new microservices. If the new service fails or isn't fully migrated, the code can still defer to the legacy implementation—this is typical of the Strangler pattern.

7. **Bulkhead Pattern**

**Description**: This pattern segments the system into isolated resources (like separate databases or queues) to prevent cascading failures, ensuring that issues in one part of the system don’t affect others.
**Benefits**: Improves fault tolerance and system stability by maintaining the ability of other services to continue functioning even when one fails.
**Example code**:
```csharp
public class UserProfileService {
    private readonly IAsyncPolicy _bulkhead;

    public UserProfileService() {
        _bulkhead = Policy.BulkheadAsync(10, 5); // 10 parallel calls, 5 queued
d    }

    public async Task<UserProfile> GetProfileAsync(string userId) {
        return await _bulkhead.ExecuteAsync(async () => {
            // Logic to get user profile
        });
    }
}
```
**Explanation**:

This example uses the Bulkhead pattern through Polly where system resources are divided into isolated segments. If one segment fails or is overloaded, the other segments can continue to function.

8. **Saga Pattern**

**Description**: Coordinates a distributed transaction across multiple microservices. Each service performs its own local transaction and publishes an event or triggers a next action, ensuring that the overall outcome can be managed.
**Benefits**: Allows for long-lived transactions without locking resources, providing flexibility and resilience in distributed systems.
**Example code**:
```csharp
public class OrderService {
    public async Task PlaceOrder(Order order) {
        // Perform local operations
        // Publish an event to trigger the next phase of the saga
        await _eventBus.PublishAsync(new OrderPlacedEvent(order.Id));
    }
}

public class PaymentService {
    public async Task HandleOrderPlaced(OrderPlacedEvent @event) {
        // Handle payment processing
    }
}
```
**Explanation**:

The Saga pattern orchestrates complex transactions across microservices by placing order events and corresponding handlers within each service. When an order is placed, the saga publishes events to ensure that the order and payment processes can coordinate seamlessly across different services.

## Microservice Communication

In a microservices architecture, services communicate with each other primarily using two main approaches: synchronous and asynchronous communication.

1. **Synchronous Communication**

**Description**: In this model, a service sends a request to another service and waits for a response. This is often implemented using HTTP REST APIs or gRPC.
**Pros**:
    - Simplicity in implementation due to well-understood protocols (like REST).
    - Easy to debug since requests and responses are immediate.
**Cons**:
    - Can lead to tight coupling between services if not handled carefully.
    - Service latency can affect the overall response time because one service must wait for another to respond.

2. **Asynchronous Communication**

**Description**: Services communicate without expecting an immediate response. This is typically achieved using message brokers (like RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, etc.) or event-driven architectures.
**Pros**:
    - Loose coupling between services, enhancing scalability and resilience since services can process messages independently.
    - Improved performance and lower latency as services do not wait for each other.
**Cons**:
    - More complex error handling and debugging.
    - Challenges in understanding the order and processing of messages.

## Recommended Best Practices

- **Use API Gateways**: Implement an API Gateway to handle requests, manage service interactions, and ensure analytics and security are applied universally.
- **Service Discovery**: Implement service discovery mechanisms to allow services to find and communicate with each other without hardcoded addresses.
- **Resilience Patterns**: Apply patterns like Circuit Breaker and Retries to handle faults gracefully in communication.
- **Documentation**: Maintain good API documentation to facilitate understanding of service interfaces and interactions.
