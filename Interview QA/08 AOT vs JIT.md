# AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation and JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation

## Definition of JIT Compilation

**JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation**: JIT is a runtime compilation technique used by many programming languages, including .NET. In JIT compilation, code is compiled from an intermediate language (like IL in .NET) to machine code just before it is executed. This means each method is compiled at its first call, optimizing performance by compiling code on demand.

## Characteristics of JIT

- **Dynamic Execution**: Code is compiled right before execution, which allows for optimizations based on current execution conditions.
- **Memory Usage**: JIT requires the runtime environment to hold both the intermediate language and the compiled machine code in memory. This can lead to higher initial overhead but optimizes execution for frequently called methods.
- **Example**: In a .NET application, when a method is called for the first time, the runtime compiles it to native code, and on subsequent calls, it executes the already compiled code.

## Definition of AOT Compilation

**AOT (Ahead of Time) Compilation**: AOT is a compilation strategy where code is fully compiled to machine code before execution, which typically occurs during the build process. Languages like C, C++, and certain compilation modes in .NET use AOT.

## Characteristics of AOT

- **No Runtime Compilation**: The code is already compiled, allowing for faster startup times since there’s no need to compile at runtime.
- **Resource Utilization**: AOT can lead to lower memory utilization since there’s no need to maintain intermediate language code in memory. However, this means less flexibility for runtime optimizations.
- **Example**: In a .NET application, using the Native Image Generator (Ngen) can create native images of assemblies ahead of time, which are then used during execution, effectively using AOT compilation.

## Key Differences

| Feature            | JIT (Just-In-Time)                        | AOT (Ahead of Time)                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Compilation Timing | At runtime, before execution              | At build time, before execution       |
| Performance Impact | Can lead to slower startup due to         | Faster startup as it's pre-compiled   |
|                    | runtime compilation                       |                                       |
| Optimization       | Can optimize based on runtime conditions  | Limited to compile-time optimizations |
| Environment        | Requires runtime presence (like CLR)      | Can run with a standalone executable  |
| Memory Footprint   | Stores both IL and machine code in memory | Lower memory usage, only machine code |


## JIT Compilation Example

**Scenario**: .NET Application with JIT Compilation
In a .NET application, when you build a project, the source code is compiled to an Intermediate Language (IL) code, which is platform-independent. When the application runs:
  - The CLR (Common Language Runtime) loads the relevant IL code.
  - Upon the first call to a method (e.g., CalculateSum), JIT compilation occurs:

```csharp
public int CalculateSum(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
```

- The CLR compiles the IL code for CalculateSum into native machine code just before execution.
- On subsequent calls, the compiled native code is executed directly, improving performance on those calls, while also optimizing based on runtime data.

**Benefit**: The JIT compiler can make optimizations based on real-time analysis, such as inlining methods or removing redundant calculations, improving runtime performance for frequently executed code.

## AOT Compilation Example

**Scenario**: .NET Native or NGen for AOT Compilation
In a .NET application, if you want to use AOT, you can leverage tools like NGen (Native Image Generator) or .NET Native.
**NGen**: Compiles an assembly to native code during installation or deployment, resulting in pre-compiled binaries, reducing startup time.

```bash
ngen install YourAssembly.dll
```

During application execution, the CLR can directly use the native images instead of interpreting IL code:

```csharp
// You updated the code and compiled it
public int Multiply(int x, int y)
{
    return x * y;
}
```

The next time the application runs, the CLR uses the AOT-compiled version of Multiply, bypassing JIT altogether.

**Benefit**: AOT reduces startup time significantly for the application because the compilation process has already occurred, and the executable can directly start executing the native code.

## Summary Comparison with Real-World Scenarios

- **JIT Example** - Asp.NET Core Application: On the first request to a web application, the JIT compiler compiles the controller methods based on incoming request patterns. This can lead to optimal performance during peak loads after the methods have been compiled, benefiting from runtime specifics.
- **AOT Example** - Xamarin Application: When building mobile applications with Xamarin, AOT compilation can improve app start times and runtime performance by compiling the application’s code directly to native ARM or X86 code ahead of time, hence reducing JIT overhead.
