# Unit of Work

## Definition:
The Unit of Work pattern is a design pattern that manages transactions across multiple operations. It acts as a single point of coordination for all changes made to objects within a particular transaction context. Essentially, it ensures that all changes to a set of objects are made in one atomic operation.

## Purpose:
The main purpose of the Unit of Work pattern is to maintain a list of objects affected by a business transaction and to coordinate the writing of changes and the resolution of concurrency problems. It helps manage the consistency and integrity of data when multiple updates, inserts, or deletes are performed.
It serves as an intermediary between the application and the database, enhancing the transactional behavior by bundling multiple operations into a single commit.

## Benefits:
- **Transaction Management**: Centralizes transaction control, allowing for a single commit or rollback, thus simplifying error handling.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces database round trips by batching commands during a single SaveChanges() call, improving application performance.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that all changes are consistently applied or none at all, adhering to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles important in database transactions.
- **Decoupled Logic**: Helps separate domain logic from data access, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

## Implementation Example in .NET:
Hereâ€™s a simplistic demonstration of how you might implement the Unit of Work pattern in a .NET application using Entity Framework:

```csharp
public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    IRepository<TEntity> GetRepository<TEntity>() where TEntity : class;
    int SaveChanges();
}

public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;
    private readonly Dictionary<Type, object> _repositories 
       = new Dictionary<Type, object>();

    public UnitOfWork(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public IRepository<TEntity> GetRepository<TEntity>() where TEntity : class
    {
        if (!_repositories.ContainsKey(typeof(TEntity)))
        {
            var repository = new Repository<TEntity>(_context);
            _repositories.Add(typeof(TEntity), repository);
        }
        return (IRepository<TEntity>)_repositories[typeof(TEntity)];
    }

    public int SaveChanges()
    {
        return _context.SaveChanges();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _context.Dispose();
    }
}
```

In this example, the UnitOfWork class manages the context and repositories. When the SaveChanges() method is called, all changes made through the repositories are committed to the database in a single transaction.

## Usage Scenario:
You might describe a scenario where multiple related operations are performed, such as adding a new order and updating customer information in one transaction. If one of these operations fails, the Unit of Work can roll back all changes to maintain data integrity.
