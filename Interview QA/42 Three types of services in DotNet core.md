In .NET Core, there are three primary types of services that can be registered in the dependency injection (DI) container, each with its own lifecycle. Describing these clearly in an interview can help emphasize your expertise while minimizing follow-up questions:

## Three Types of Services in .NET Core:

### 1. Transient Services:
**Definition**: Transient services are created each time they are requested. This means that if a component requests a transient service multiple times, a new instance is created for each request.
**Use Case**: Use transient services for lightweight, stateless services that require fresh instances due to their non-caching nature, such as services that provide data transformation or temporary calculations.

**Registration Example**:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IMyTransientService, MyTransientService>();
```

### 2. Scoped Services:
**Definition**: Scoped services are created once per client request (connection). A single instance is used throughout a request and shared among components that require it within the same request.
**Use Case**: This is ideal for services that are stateful or hold data that should only live during a single request, such as database contexts in an ASP.NET Core application.

**Registration Example**:

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IMyScopedService, MyScopedService>();
```

### 3. Singleton Services:
**Definition**: Singleton services are created once and shared throughout the applicationâ€™s lifecycle. This means that every time a component requests a singleton service, it receives the same instance.
**Use Case**: Use singleton services for global application state or for services that are expensive to create and are mostly stateless, such as configuration settings or logging services.

**Registration Example**:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IMySingletonService, MySingletonService>();
```
