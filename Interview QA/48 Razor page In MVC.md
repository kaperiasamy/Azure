# Razor page In MVC

Razor Pages is a feature in ASP.NET Core MVC that simplifies the structure of web applications by providing a page-based model for building interactive web pages. Here’s how to explain the purpose of Razor Pages in MVC projects during an interview, allowing you to demonstrate your expertise while minimizing follow-up questions:
Purpose of Razor Pages in MVC Projects:

## Simplified Page Structure:
- **Definition**: Razor Pages provides an alternative to traditional MVC views by organizing code around a page rather than a controller/action pair. Each page is self-contained with its own View (Razor file) and its associated Page Model (code-behind), which makes it easier to manage and develop.
- **Benefit**: This results in a clearer structure for applications where each page is treated as an individual entity, making it simple to handle page-related logic and data without the need for a dedicated controller.
- **Example**: A Razor Page for a specific task, such as a contact form, would consist of a single .cshtml file for the view and a corresponding .cshtml.cs file for any related logic.

## Enhanced Productivity:
- **Development Efficiency**: Razor Pages streamline the development process by reducing the amount of code required for setting up request handling, especially for forms, list pages, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Shortened Boilerplate**: With Razor Pages, you don’t explicitly need to define actions in controllers unless needed, reducing boilerplate code and allowing for faster development of individual pages.
- **Example**: You can quickly scaffold a Razor Page with built-in support for model binding and validation, speeding up the creation of forms.

## Better Separation of Concerns:
- **Encapsulation of Logic**: Razor Pages encourage a clean separation of concerns by keeping the HTML markup (view) and server-side logic (code-behind) together yet separate from other pages and controllers. This encapsulation promotes maintainability.
- **App Structure**: Developers can manage business logic related to specific views without cluttering controllers, which enhances clarity and maintainability in larger applications.

## Integrated Model Binding and Validation:
- **Data Handling**: Razor Pages support strong model binding and built-in validation features out of the box, allowing developers to easily work with form submissions and handle validation results transparently.
- **Example**: Defining a PageModel with properties decorated with validation attributes will automatically validate user inputs when the page is submitted, simplifying data handling.

```csharp
public class ContactModel : PageModel
{
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public void OnPost()
    {
        // Handle form submission
    }
}
```
