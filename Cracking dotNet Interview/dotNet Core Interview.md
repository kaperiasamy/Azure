I may have an interview in a day or two. The main areas covered will be .NET Core and Web API. Mostly the questions will be on how I design an application, what are the design patterns used, how that design patterns are implemented, what is the purpose of the design pattern used for (which problem it solved), what are the design principles used, how those design principles are implemented, something like this. Get me the list of questions (full list of most important questions) that may be asked, which includes scenario-based questions.

- **Notification Service**: Email, SMS, Push Notifications

---

## **2. PATTERN CHOICES & ALTERNATIVES**

### **Primary Patterns Used**

#### **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
```csharp
// Command - Write Operations
public class CreateEmployeeCommand : IRequest<CreateEmployeeResponse>
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public int DepartmentId { get; set; }
    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
    public int TenantId { get; set; }
}

// Query - Read Operations  
public class GetEmployeeQuery : IRequest<EmployeeDto>
{
    public int EmployeeId { get; set; }
    public int TenantId { get; set; }
}

// Handler Implementation
public class CreateEmployeeCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateEmployeeCommand, CreateEmployeeResponse>
{
    private readonly IEmployeeRepository _repository;
    private readonly IEventBus _eventBus;
    
    public async Task<CreateEmployeeResponse> Handle(CreateEmployeeCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var employee = Employee.Create(request.FirstName, request.LastName, request.Email, request.TenantId);
        await _repository.AddAsync(employee);
        
        // Publish domain event
        await _eventBus.PublishAsync(new EmployeeCreatedEvent(employee.Id, employee.TenantId));
        
        return new CreateEmployeeResponse { EmployeeId = employee.Id };
    }
}
```

**Why CQRS?**
- Separate read/write models for complex ERP operations
- Different optimization strategies for queries vs commands
- Better scalability with separate read/write databases

**Alternative**: Traditional Repository pattern (simpler but less scalable)

#### **Multi-Tenant Strategy Pattern**
```csharp
// Tenant Resolution Strategy
public interface ITenantResolver
{
    int ResolveTenantId(HttpContext context);
}

public class HeaderTenantResolver : ITenantResolver
{
    public int ResolveTenantId(HttpContext context)
    {
        return int.Parse(context.Request.Headers["X-Tenant-Id"].FirstOrDefault() ?? "0");
    }
}

public class SubdomainTenantResolver : ITenantResolver
{
    public int ResolveTenantId(HttpContext context)
    {
        var host = context.Request.Host.Host;
        var subdomain = host.Split('.').FirstOrDefault();
        return GetTenantIdFromSubdomain(subdomain);
    }
}

// Multi-tenant middleware
public class TenantMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ITenantResolver _tenantResolver;
    
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, ITenantResolver tenantResolver)
    {
        var tenantId = tenantResolver.ResolveTenantId(context);
        context.Items["TenantId"] = tenantId;
        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

#### **Unit of Work with Repository Pattern**
```csharp
public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    IEmployeeRepository Employees { get; }
    IPayrollRepository Payrolls { get; }
    IInventoryRepository Inventory { get; }
    Task<int> CommitAsync();
    Task RollbackAsync();
}

public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork
{
    private readonly ERPDbContext _context;
    private readonly ITenantContext _tenantContext;
    
    public UnitOfWork(ERPDbContext context, ITenantContext tenantContext)
    {
        _context = context;
        _tenantContext = tenantContext;
    }
    
    public async Task<int> CommitAsync()
    {
        using var transaction = await _context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();
        try
        {
            var result = await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
            await transaction.CommitAsync();
            return result;
        }
        catch
        {
            await transaction.RollbackAsync();
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

## **3. CODE IMPLEMENTATIONS**

### **Employee Management API**
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/v1/employees")]
[Authorize]
public class EmployeesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator;
    private readonly ITenantContext _tenantContext;
    
    [HttpPost]
    [HasPermission("employees.create")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<CreateEmployeeResponse>> CreateEmployee(CreateEmployeeCommand command)
    {
        command.TenantId = _tenantContext.TenantId;
        var result = await _mediator.Send(command);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetEmployee), new { id = result.EmployeeId }, result);
    }
    
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    [HasPermission("employees.read")]
    [ResponseCache(Duration = 300, VaryByHeader = "X-Tenant-Id")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<EmployeeDto>> GetEmployee(int id)
    {
        var query = new GetEmployeeQuery { EmployeeId = id, TenantId = _tenantContext.TenantId };
        var result = await _mediator.Send(query);
        return Ok(result);
    }
}
```

### **Payroll Processing with Saga Pattern**
```csharp
// Saga for complex payroll processing
public class PayrollProcessingSaga : ISaga<PayrollInitiatedEvent>, 
                                    ISaga<SalaryCalculatedEvent>,
                                    ISaga<TaxCalculatedEvent>
{
    public async Task Handle(PayrollInitiatedEvent @event)
    {
        // Step 1: Calculate base salary
        await _mediator.Send(new CalculateSalaryCommand(@event.PayrollId));
    }
    
    public async Task Handle(SalaryCalculatedEvent @event)
    {
        // Step 2: Calculate taxes
        await _mediator.Send(new CalculateTaxCommand(@event.PayrollId, @event.BaseSalary));
    }
    
    public async Task Handle(TaxCalculatedEvent @event)
    {
        // Step 3: Generate pay slip and send notification
        await _mediator.Send(new GeneratePaySlipCommand(@event.PayrollId));
        await _mediator.Send(new SendPayrollNotificationCommand(@event.EmployeeId));
    }
}
```

## **4. SCALABILITY & PERFORMANCE**

### **Horizontal Scaling Strategies**

#### **Database Sharding by Tenant**
```csharp
public class TenantDbContextFactory : IDbContextFactory<ERPDbContext>
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    
    public ERPDbContext CreateDbContext(int tenantId)
    {
        var shardKey = tenantId % 4; // 4 database shards
        var connectionString = _configuration.GetConnectionString($"Shard{shardKey}");
        
        var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<ERPDbContext>()
            .UseSqlServer(connectionString)
            .Options;
            
        return new ERPDbContext(options, tenantId);
    }
}
```

#### **Redis Distributed Caching**
```csharp
public class CachedEmployeeRepository : IEmployeeRepository
{
    private readonly IEmployeeRepository _repository;
    private readonly IDistributedCache _cache;
    private readonly ITenantContext _tenantContext;
    
    public async Task<Employee> GetByIdAsync(int id)
    {
        var cacheKey = $"employee:{_tenantContext.TenantId}:{id}";
        var cached = await _cache.GetStringAsync(cacheKey);
        
        if (cached != null)
            return JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Employee>(cached);
            
        var employee = await _repository.GetByIdAsync(id);
        
        await _cache.SetStringAsync(cacheKey, JsonSerializer.Serialize(employee),
            new DistributedCacheEntryOptions { AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15) });
            
        return employee;
    }
}
```

#### **Background Job Processing**
```csharp
// Payroll processing background job
[AutomaticRetry(Attempts = 3)]
public class PayrollProcessingJob : IBackgroundJob
{
    public async Task Execute(PayrollProcessingRequest request)
    {
        var employees = await _employeeRepository.GetActiveEmployeesAsync(request.TenantId);
        
        var tasks = employees.Select(async employee => 
        {
            await _mediator.Send(new ProcessEmployeePayrollCommand 
            { 
                EmployeeId = employee.Id, 
                PayPeriod = request.PayPeriod 
            });
        });
        
        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
    }
}
```

---

## **5. SECURITY CONCERNS**

### **JWT Authentication with Role-Based Authorization**
```csharp
[HasPermission("payroll.process")]
[RequiresTenant]
public class PayrollController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost("process")]
    [RateLimiting(MaxRequests = 5, WindowMinutes = 60)] // Prevent abuse
    public async Task<IActionResult> ProcessPayroll(ProcessPayrollCommand command)
    {
        // Audit logging
        _auditLogger.LogAction("PayrollProcessing", HttpContext.User.Identity.Name, 
                              _tenantContext.TenantId, command);
        
        var result = await _mediator.Send(command);
        return Ok(result);
    }
}

// Custom authorization attribute
public class HasPermissionAttribute : AuthorizeAttribute, IAuthorizationRequirement
{
    public string Permission { get; }
    
    public HasPermissionAttribute(string permission)
    {
        Permission = permission;
        Policy = permission;
    }
}

// Permission handler
public class PermissionAuthorizationHandler : AuthorizationHandler<HasPermissionAttribute>
{
    protected override async Task HandleRequirementAsync(
        AuthorizationHandlerContext context,
        HasPermissionAttribute requirement)
    {
        var tenantId = context.Resource as int?;
        var userPermissions = await _permissionService.GetUserPermissionsAsync(
            context.User.Identity.Name, tenantId);
            
        if (userPermissions.Contains(requirement.Permission))
        {
            context.Succeed(requirement);
        }
    }
}
```

### **Data Encryption & PII Protection**
```csharp
// Sensitive data encryption
public class Employee
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    
    [Encrypted] // Custom attribute for automatic encryption
    public string SSN { get; set; }
    
    [Encrypted]
    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
    
    public int TenantId { get; set; }
}

// Encryption interceptor
public class EncryptionInterceptor : SaveChangesInterceptor
{
    private readonly IDataProtector _protector;
    
    public override ValueTask<InterceptionResult<int>> SavingChangesAsync(
        DbContextEventData eventData, 
        InterceptionResult<int> result, 
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        EncryptProperties(eventData.Context);
        return base.SavingChangesAsync(eventData, result, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

---

## **6. TESTING APPROACH**

### **Unit Testing with Domain-Driven Design**
```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class EmployeeTests
{
    [Test]
    public void Employee_Create_Should_Raise_EmployeeCreatedEvent()
    {
        // Arrange
        var firstName = "John";
        var lastName = "Doe";
        var email = "john@company.com";
        var tenantId = 1;
        
        // Act
        var employee = Employee.Create(firstName, lastName, email, tenantId);
        
        // Assert
        employee.FirstName.Should().Be(firstName);
        employee.DomainEvents.Should().ContainSingle()
            .Which.Should().BeOfType<EmployeeCreatedEvent>();
    }
    
    [Test]
    public async Task CreateEmployeeCommandHandler_Should_Save_Employee_And_Publish_Event()
    {
        // Arrange
        var command = new CreateEmployeeCommand 
        { 
            FirstName = "John", 
            LastName = "Doe", 
            Email = "john@test.com",
            TenantId = 1 
        };
        
        var mockRepository = new Mock<IEmployeeRepository>();
        var mockEventBus = new Mock<IEventBus>();
        var handler = new CreateEmployeeCommandHandler(mockRepository.Object, mockEventBus.Object);
        
        // Act
        var result = await handler.Handle(command, CancellationToken.None);
        
        // Assert
        mockRepository.Verify(x => x.AddAsync(It.IsAny<Employee>()), Times.Once);
        mockEventBus.Verify(x => x.PublishAsync(It.IsAny<EmployeeCreatedEvent>()), Times.Once);
    }
}
```

### **Integration Testing with TestContainers**
```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class EmployeeApiIntegrationTests
{
    private WebApplicationFactory<Program> _factory;
    private HttpClient _client;
    private PostgreSqlContainer _dbContainer;
    
    [OneTimeSetUp]
    public async Task OneTimeSetUp()
    {
        _dbContainer = new PostgreSqlBuilder()
            .WithImage("postgres:13")
            .WithDatabase("erp_test")
            .Build();
            
        await _dbContainer.StartAsync();
        
        _factory = new WebApplicationFactory<Program>()
            .WithWebHostBuilder(builder =>
            {
                builder.ConfigureTestServices(services =>
                {
                    services.AddDbContext<ERPDbContext>(options =>
                        options.UseNpgsql(_dbContainer.GetConnectionString()));
                });
            });
            
        _client = _factory.CreateClient();
    }
    
    [Test]
    public async Task CreateEmployee_Should_Return_Created_Status()
    {
        // Arrange
        var command = new CreateEmployeeCommand 
        { 
            FirstName = "John", 
            LastName = "Doe", 
            Email = "john@test.com" 
        };
        
        _client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("X-Tenant-Id", "1");
        _client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
            new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", await GetValidJwtToken());
        
        // Act
        var response = await _client.PostAsJsonAsync("/api/v1/employees", command);
        
        // Assert
        response.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.Created);
        var result = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<CreateEmployeeResponse>();
        result.EmployeeId.Should().BeGreaterThan(0);
    }
}
```

### **Performance Testing Strategy**
```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class PayrollPerformanceTests
{
    [Test]
    public async Task ProcessPayroll_Should_Handle_1000_Employees_Within_30_Seconds()
    {
        // Arrange
        var employees = GenerateTestEmployees(1000);
        var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        
        // Act
        var result = await _payrollService.ProcessBulkPayrollAsync(employees, DateTime.Now);
        
        // Assert
        stopwatch.Stop();
        stopwatch.Elapsed.Should().BeLessThan(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
        result.ProcessedCount.Should().Be(1000);
        result.FailedCount.Should().Be(0);
    }
}
```

## **INTERVIEW RESPONSE STRUCTURE**

### **When Asked: "How would you design an ERP system API?"**

1. **Start with Domain Understanding**:
   "ERP systems have complex business workflows, multi-tenant requirements, and need strong consistency. I'd use Clean Architecture with CQRS to separate complex read/write operations..."

2. **Explain Pattern Choices**:
   "I chose CQRS because payroll processing involves complex calculations but reporting needs optimized queries. The Unit of Work pattern ensures transaction consistency across multiple entities..."

3. **Address Scalability**:
   "For scaling, I'd implement tenant-based sharding, Redis caching for frequently accessed data like employee details, and background job processing for long-running operations like payroll..."

4. **Security Focus**:
   "ERP systems handle sensitive PII and financial data. I'd implement JWT with fine-grained permissions, encrypt sensitive fields at rest, and maintain comprehensive audit logs..."

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   "I'd focus on domain logic unit tests, integration tests with TestContainers for database scenarios, and performance tests to ensure payroll processing meets SLA requirements..."

---

## **KEY INTERVIEW TIPS**

1. **Always mention multi-tenancy** - ERP systems serve multiple companies
2. **Emphasize data consistency** - Financial data accuracy is critical
3. **Discuss audit trails** - Regulatory compliance requirements
4. **Address bulk operations** - Payroll processes thousands of records
5. **Consider background processing** - Long-running financial calculations
6. **Mention reporting performance** - Executives need fast dashboards

This comprehensive strategy demonstrates deep understanding of enterprise-level API design with real-world ERP complexity.

### **Code Examples to Practice:**

Prepare **10-15 line code snippets** for:
- DI container registration
- Repository pattern implementation  
- Middleware creation
- Custom attribute validation
- Strategy pattern for business rules
- Factory pattern for service creation

**Pro Tip**: For each pattern, know:
1. **What problem it solves**
2. **When NOT to use it**
3. **How to test it**
4. **Performance implications**
5. **Real-world alternatives**

This comprehensive list covers 95% of what you'll encounter in .NET Core/Web API design-focused interviews. Focus on the "Most Critical Questions" first, then expand to scenario-based questions.
