1. Delegate
- A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a specific signature.
- It can hold references to one or more methods.
- You can invoke the methods directly using the delegate.
  
Example:
```csharp
public delegate void MyDelegate(string message);

MyDelegate del = SomeMethod;
del("Hello");
```

---

2. Event
- An event is a wrapper around a delegate, used to provide a publish/subscribe model.
- Events restrict access: only the class that declares the event can raise (invoke) it; other classes can only subscribe/unsubscribe.
- Used heavily in GUI programming, real-time updates, etc.

Example:
```csharp
public class MyClass {
    public event MyDelegate MyEvent;

    public void RaiseEvent() {
        MyEvent?.Invoke("Event triggered");
    }
}
```

| Feature               | Delegate                        | Event                               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Type or member?   | It's a type                 | It's a member based on delegate |

| Usage             | General-purpose method pointers | Used for notifications and pub-sub |
| Encapsulation     | Less restricted                 | More controlled and secure      |

In short:  
Delegates = method pointers  
Events = controlled, delegate-based notification mechanism
