Hi, I’m a .NET developer with over 16 years of experience primarily working with C#, .NET, .NET Core, Web APIs, and Azure. I’m currently preparing for an online screening test that comes before a technical interview for a senior individual contributor role in the banking domain. I'm not sure what to expect from the screening test. Could you please shed some light on the types of questions that are typically asked, so I can prepare accordingly?

Given your extensive background and the banking domain context, here's what you can typically expect in a senior .NET developer screening test:

## Technical Fundamentals
- **C# language features**: LINQ, generics, delegates, async/await patterns, nullable reference types, records, pattern matching
- **.NET Core/.NET 5+**: Dependency injection, middleware pipeline, configuration management, hosting models
- **Memory management**: Garbage collection, IDisposable pattern, memory leaks, performance considerations

## Web API & Architecture
- **RESTful API design**: HTTP verbs, status codes, versioning strategies, content negotiation
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0, role-based access control, claims-based identity
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware creation, request/response pipeline, error handling
- **Design patterns**: Repository, Unit of Work, CQRS, Mediator pattern

## Banking Domain Specific
- **Security**: Data encryption, PCI compliance, secure coding practices, input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **Concurrency**: Thread safety, locks, concurrent collections, handling race conditions in financial transactions
- **Data consistency**: ACID properties, transaction management, distributed transactions
- **Regulatory compliance**: Audit trails, data retention, logging requirements

## Azure & Cloud
- **Azure services**: App Service, SQL Database, Key Vault, Service Bus, Functions
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights, logging strategies, health checks
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, blue-green deployments

## Database & Performance
- **Entity Framework Core**: Code-first migrations, query optimization, change tracking
- **SQL Server**: Indexing strategies, stored procedures, performance tuning
- **Caching**: Redis, in-memory caching, cache-aside patterns

## Problem-Solving Scenarios
- Code review exercises identifying bugs or improvements
- System design questions for payment processing or transaction systems
- Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks
- Handling high-volume, low-latency requirements

## Soft Skills Assessment
- Communication of technical concepts
- Approach to debugging complex issues
- Experience with agile methodologies
- Mentoring and code review practices

Focus your preparation on security, performance, and reliability aspects since these are critical in banking. Practice explaining complex technical concepts clearly, as communication skills are often evaluated alongside technical knowledge.

--- 
Online screening test platforms for senior .NET roles typically use these formats:

## Multiple Choice Questions (Most Common)
- **C# syntax and concepts**: "What's the output of this code snippet?"
- **Framework knowledge**: "Which method is used for dependency injection in .NET Core?"
- **Best practices**: "Which approach is most secure for storing connection strings?"
- **Design patterns**: "When would you use the Repository pattern?"

## Code Reading/Analysis
- **Debug scenarios**: Given buggy code, identify the issue
- **Code review**: "What's wrong with this implementation?"
- **Output prediction**: "What will this LINQ query return?"
- **Performance analysis**: "Which version performs better and why?"

## Fill-in-the-Blanks
- Complete missing code segments
- Fill in correct attribute names, method signatures
- Complete SQL queries or LINQ expressions

## Short Coding Exercises (Less Common but Growing)
- **Simple algorithms**: String manipulation, array operations, basic sorting
- **LINQ queries**: Transform data, filter collections
- **Basic class design**: Implement an interface, create a simple model
- **Unit test writing**: Write test cases for given methods

## System Design (High-Level)
- **Architecture questions**: "How would you design a payment processing system?"
- **Technology choices**: "Why choose microservices vs monolith?"
- **Scalability scenarios**: Multiple choice about handling load

## Typical Platform Examples:
- **HackerRank**: Mix of MCQs and coding problems
- **Codility**: Algorithm-focused with some domain questions
- **HackerEarth**: Technical MCQs with coding challenges
- **Custom platforms**: Usually MCQ-heavy with scenario-based questions

## Time Constraints:
- Usually 60-90 minutes total
- 30-50 questions for MCQ format
- 2-3 coding problems if included

## Preparation Tips:
1. **Practice MCQs** on C# fundamentals, .NET Core features
2. **Review common patterns** - Singleton, Factory, Repository
3. **Brush up algorithms** - basic sorting, searching, string manipulation
4. **Practice LINQ** - complex queries, joins, grouping
5. **Study Azure basics** - common services and their use cases
6. **Security concepts** - authentication, encryption, best practices

The key is breadth over depth initially - these tests often cover many topics quickly rather than deep algorithmic challenges.

        CancellationToken = cancellationToken
    };
    
    // Process transactions in batches to manage memory
    var batches = transactions.Chunk(1000);
    var results = new ConcurrentBag<TransactionResult>();
    
    await Parallel.ForEachAsync(batches, options, async (batch, ct) =>
    {
        using var scope = _serviceProvider.CreateScope();
        var processor = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ITransactionProcessor>();
        var batchResults = await processor.ProcessBatchAsync(batch, ct);
        
        foreach (var result in batchResults)
