Dependency Injection Lifecycles in .NET 🧐
 Here’s your quick guide to DI in .NET Core:
🔹 Singleton ♾️
 ✅ One instance for the entire application
 ✅ Perfect for stateless, shared services (e.g., Logger)
 ❌ Dangerous for storing state!
🔹 Scoped 🔄
 ✅ One instance per user request (e.g., in a web app)
 ✅ Ideal for Entity Framework DbContexts
 ❌ Not thread-safe outside a request
🔹 Transient ⚡
 ✅ A new instance is created every time it’s requested
 ✅ Great for lightweight, stateless services
 ❌ Can cause memory overhead if overused
💡 Quick Recap:
Singleton = Shared, global state
Scoped = Per user session/request
Transient = Always new, never shared
Mastering these lifecycles will level up your architecture and prevent nasty bugs. 🚀

What’s the difference between a Monolith and Microservices architecture?
Many engineers jump into microservices too quickly, but let’s break it down.

🔹 Monolith

Single deployable unit

Easy to start, harder to scale

Tight coupling = one bug can affect the whole system


🔹 Microservices

System split into independent services

Scalable, flexible, and resilient

Comes with complexity: service discovery, communication, DevOps overhead

---

💡 TL;DR:

Monolith = simple start, complex growth

Microservices = complex start, scalable growth

---

🎯 Real-life Example (Gulf context)
A fintech startup in Dubai might begin with a monolith for faster time-to-market.
As the user base grows, they transition to microservices to handle scaling, integrations, and distributed teams.

ActionResult vs ViewResult vs JsonResult in ASP.NET MVC
In ASP.NET MVC, all of these return types are used in controllers — but when should you use each?
🔹 ActionResult
Base class for all results
Flexible → can return View, Json, Redirect, File, etc.

public ActionResult Index() => View();
🔹 ViewResult
Returns a View (.cshtml) to the browser
Specific for rendering HTML

public ViewResult Index() => View("Home");
🔹 JsonResult
Returns JSON data (commonly used in APIs / AJAX calls)

public JsonResult GetData() => Json(new { Name = "Ali", Age = 30 });
💡 TL;DR
Use ActionResult → when you need flexibility
Use ViewResult → when rendering HTML views
Use JsonResult → when building APIs / AJAX responses
📌 Pro Tip: In modern ASP.NET Core, prefer IActionResult or ActionResult<T> for more type-safety.

🎯 How Great .NET Developers Stand Out in Interviews

When I sit in .NET interviews, there’s always a clear difference:
👉 Developers who focus on definitions often get shortlisted.
👉 Developers who explain real-world impact usually get hired.

Example:
❓ “Why do we use async/await in C#?”
 • ❌ Average response: “It allows asynchronous programming.”
 • ✅ Strong response: “It avoids blocking critical threads, improves responsiveness, and saves resources because fewer threads sit idle.”

Notice the difference?
One just recites knowledge. The other shows engineering thinking + business value.

🔑 A simple 3-step way to structure your answers:
1️⃣ What it is – show you know the feature.
2️⃣ Why it matters – explain the problem it solves.
3️⃣ Business/technical outcome – connect to performance, scale, or cost.

💡 Try applying this to modern .NET 8 features:
 • Frozen Collections → Faster immutable lookups, less GC overhead.
 • Primary Constructors → More concise code, easier maintenance, fewer bugs over time.

Because at the end of the day, companies don’t just want coders—they want engineers who see the bigger picture.

🚨 SOAP vs REST – What’s the Real Difference in APIs?

When designing or consuming web services, two major styles dominate the landscape: SOAP and REST. While they both allow communication between systems, their architecture and usage vary significantly.

Let’s break it down: 👇


🧾 SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

🔹 Protocol: A strict, standardized protocol
🔹 Data Format: XML only (verbose but structured)
🔹 Standards-Based: WSDL for definitions, WS-Security for encryption/auth
🔹 Transport Support: Works over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.
🔹 Tightly Coupled: Strong contracts make it harder to evolve services
🔹 Use Case: Enterprise systems, banking, government services

🧠 Example SOAP message:

<soap:Envelope>
 <soap:Body>
 <GetUserDetails>
 <UserID>123</UserID>
 </GetUserDetails>
 </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>


🌐 REST (Representational State Transfer)

🔹 Architecture Style: Not a protocol, but a design pattern
🔹 Data Format: JSON (mostly), XML, or even plain text
🔹 Stateless: Each request is independent
🔹 Lightweight: No extra headers or envelope required
🔹 Transport: Primarily HTTP
🔹 Use Case: Web/mobile apps, CRUD services, open APIs

🧠 Example REST request:

GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com


🔍 Key Differences: SOAP vs REST

| Feature         | SOAP                            | REST                                |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Type**        | Protocol                        | Architectural style                 |
| **Format**      | XML only                        | JSON, XML, HTML, etc.               |
| **Performance** | Heavy (due to XML + envelope)   | Lightweight and faster               |
| **Standards**   | Strict (WSDL, WS-Security)      | Flexible                            |
| **Stateless**   | Optional                        | Always stateless                    |
| **Error Handling** | Built-in (fault codes)       | Depends on HTTP status codes        |
| **Use Case**    | Enterprise apps, legacy systems | Modern web/mobile apps, public APIs |




💡 Takeaway:
If you’re building scalable, lightweight apps — REST is usually the go-to. But if you're in a high-security, contract-heavy, or legacy enterprise environment, SOAP still holds its ground.

🧠 .NET Runtimes Explained:
 CLR vs CoreCLR vs Mono vs NativeAOT
If you’ve ever wondered how .NET code runs under the hood, you're really asking: "Which runtime is managing my code?"

Let’s dive into the different .NET runtimes and how they compare in behavior, performance, and use cases. 👇

👉 Middleware are pipeline components that handle HTTP requests/responses. You can add logging, authentication, error handling, and more!

💡 Q6: What is the difference between IEnumerable, IQueryable, and List?
👉 IEnumerable works in memory, IQueryable allows deferred execution on the database, and List is a concrete collection.

💡 Q7: What are sealed, abstract, and static classes?
👉 sealed = can’t be inherited,
abstract = must be inherited,
static = can't be instantiated.

💡 Q8: What is model binding in ASP.NET MVC/Core?
👉 It maps HTTP request data to action parameters, handling form data, query strings, and JSON bodies.

💡 Q9: How do you handle exceptions globally in ASP.NET Core?
👉 Use UseExceptionHandler, UseDeveloperExceptionPage, or custom middleware.

💡 Q10: What is the difference between Task.Run() and Task.Factory.StartNew()?

📌 Tip: Interviews aren't just about correct answers — they're about confidence, communication, and clarity.

🔧 .NET Interview Questions You’ll Only Hear from Real-World Engineers
(Not from textbooks – but from real meetings, whiteboards, and production fires!🔥)

You’ve nailed the basics. Now let’s step into the type of questions that test how you build, break, and fix things in real apps.



🔹 Q1: How would you handle high memory usage in a .NET Core application?
👉 Use diagnostic tools like dotMemory or Visual Studio Profiler. Look for memory leaks, large object heaps, or improper IDisposable usage. Add GC.Collect() only when absolutely necessary.

🔹 Q2: What’s your approach to database migrations in EF Core in a CI/CD pipeline?
👉 Use dotnet ef migrations script to generate SQL, review manually, and execute through a migration tool or script step in your deployment pipeline.

🔹 Q3: How do you prevent overposting in ASP.NET Core MVC?
👉 Use view models instead of binding directly to entities. Also, whitelist properties with [Bind] or use [FromBody] for explicit control in APIs.

🔹 Q4: How do you secure Web APIs in .NET Core?
👉 Use JWT Bearer authentication, validate scopes, apply role-based policies, and always validate input. Use HTTPS + CORS + throttling + logging!

🔹 Q5: What’s your approach to retry logic for transient errors?
👉 Use Polly for policies like Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout. Keep retry count and delay sensible — and always log failures.

🔹 Q6: How would you handle versioning in ASP.NET Core APIs?
👉 Use headers, query parameters, or route versioning via Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning. Always document your version strategy.

🔹 Q7: How do you test performance bottlenecks in your code?
👉 Use BenchmarkDotNet or built-in Stopwatch + diagnostics. Profile APIs with Postman, Application Insights, or MiniProfiler.

🔹 Q8: What’s the cleanest way to implement caching in .NET Core?
👉 Use IMemoryCache for in-memory, IDistributedCache for external. Set appropriate expiration and eviction policies.

🔹 Q9: What is the benefit of using Minimal APIs in .NET 6/7+?
👉 Great for microservices, fast startup, less boilerplate. You trade off some structure for simplicity and performance.

🔹 Q10: When do you use ConfigureAwait(false)?
👉 Use it in libraries or background code to prevent deadlocks and avoid resuming on the captured context — especially outside of ASP.NET Core.


📌 Interviews test more than syntax. They test how you think in production.
If you've faced these situations, you're already more prepared than you think.

🚀 .NET Performance & Scalability Interview Questions – Be Ready for the Real Grind!

When you're aiming for a backend or architecture-level role, interviewers want to know:
💡 Can your code scale?
⚙️ Can your system survive load spikes?
🧠 Do you understand what's happening under the hood?

Here are 10 solid questions (with crisp answers) you must know:



🔹 Q1: How do you reduce memory allocations in a high-load .NET app?
👉 Use object pooling (ArrayPool, ObjectPool), avoid boxing/unboxing, and cache frequently used data.

🔹 Q2: What is the difference between Task.Run, async/await, and Parallel.ForEach?
👉 Task.Run starts background work, async/await is for non-blocking IO, Parallel.ForEach is CPU-bound and uses multiple threads.

🔹 Q3: How do you improve cold start time in ASP.NET Core?
👉 Minimize middleware, avoid heavy service initialization at startup, use ReadyToRun compilation and precompiled Razor views.

🔹 Q4: When should you use Span<T> or Memory<T> in .NET?
👉 When working with slices of arrays, strings, or buffers without allocations — especially for performance-critical operations.

🔹 Q5: What is caching, and which types are used in .NET?
👉 In-memory (IMemoryCache), distributed (IDistributedCache, Redis), output caching (middleware), and data-layer caching (EF second-level cache).

🔹 Q6: How would you profile a slow-running .NET API?
👉 Use Application Insights, MiniProfiler, or dotTrace to identify bottlenecks in DB, code, or external dependencies.

🔹 Q7: How do you make EF Core queries faster?
👉 Use AsNoTracking(), project to DTOs, use indexes in DB, minimize includes, and avoid N+1 queries.

🔹 Q8: What is the difference between thread and task in .NET?
👉 Thread is a physical execution unit, while Task is a logical unit of asynchronous work managed by the Task Scheduler.

🔹 Q9: How does Garbage Collection affect performance?
👉 Frequent or full GCs pause the app. Optimize allocation patterns, avoid unnecessary large object heap usage.

🔹 Q10: How do you scale a .NET Core app horizontally?
👉 Use load balancers, stateless services, externalize session state (e.g., Redis), containerize with Docker, and deploy on Kubernetes/Azure App Service.


🎯 Ace Your .NET Interview – Master These Design Pattern Questions (with Answers!)
Whether you're applying for a backend role, architect position, or simply sharpening your development skills — understanding design patterns is a must for any .NET developer.

Here are 7 important .NET design pattern questions interviewers love to ask, along with clear answers to help you stand out:


🔹 Q1: What is the Singleton Pattern and when should you use it in .NET?
✅ Answer: The Singleton pattern ensures only one instance of a class exists across the application.
Use Case: Logging, caching, configuration settings, etc.
In .NET, we can implement it with lazy initialization:

public sealed class Logger {
 private static readonly Lazy<Logger> instance = new(() => new Logger());
 public static Logger Instance => instance.Value;
 private Logger() { }
}


🔹 Q2: What is the Repository Pattern? How is it useful with Entity Framework?
✅ Answer: It abstracts data access logic and separates it from business logic. It works well with EF by exposing methods like GetAll, Find, Add, and Remove on entities.
Benefits: Testability, separation of concerns, and cleaner architecture.


🔹 Q3: Explain the Factory Method Pattern.
✅ Answer: The Factory Method pattern lets you delegate object creation to subclasses.
Use Case: When the exact type of the object isn’t known until runtime.
Example: Creating different payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) based on user choice.


🔹 Q4: What is Dependency Injection (DI) and how does .NET Core support it?
✅ Answer: DI is a pattern where dependencies are injected into a class rather than created inside.
.NET Core has built-in support for DI using IServiceCollection and IServiceProvider.
Example:

services.AddScoped<IEmailService, SmtpEmailService>();


🔹 Q5: Difference between Strategy and State Patterns?
✅ Answer:

Strategy: Used to switch between algorithms (e.g., different sorting strategies).

State: Used to change behavior based on internal state (e.g., workflow stages).
Both promote open/closed principle but have different intent.



🔹 Q6: What is the Mediator Pattern and why is it useful?
✅ Answer: It reduces direct communication between components, instead letting them communicate via a central mediator.
Use Case: In MVVM or CQRS patterns, Mediator helps decouple UI from backend logic.


🔹 Q7: How would you use the Adapter Pattern in a legacy integration?
✅ Answer: It allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
Example: Wrapping an old XML-based system so it can be called using a modern JSON-based API.
Adapter pattern provides a bridge without modifying existing code.

💼 .NET Developer Interview Q&A — Detailed Guide for 2025

Cracking a technical interview is not just about knowing the answers — it’s about showing your understanding, problem-solving approach, and practical experience.
Here are 5 commonly asked .NET interview questions with detailed answers to help you prepare.



1️⃣ What is the difference between Task, Thread, and Async/Await in .NET?
🔹 Thread → The actual OS-level unit of execution. You control it manually (start, stop, manage lifecycle).
🔹 Task → A higher-level abstraction over threads, part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL), which manages scheduling for you.
🔹 Async/Await → Keywords that simplify asynchronous programming, letting you write non-blocking code that looks synchronous.

💡 Tip: Emphasize that async/await does not create new threads — it frees the current thread while waiting.



2️⃣ What is Dependency Injection (DI) and why is it important?
Dependency Injection is a design pattern where an object’s dependencies are supplied by an external source rather than hard-coded inside the class.

Benefits:
✅ Loose coupling
✅ Easier testing (mocking dependencies)
✅ Better code maintainability

Example:

public class OrderService {
 private readonly IPaymentGateway _paymentGateway;
 public OrderService(IPaymentGateway paymentGateway) {
 _paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
 }
}

Here, IPaymentGateway is injected, making OrderService testable and flexible.



3️⃣ How does garbage collection work in .NET?
Garbage Collection (GC) automatically frees memory used by objects that are no longer accessible.
It works in generations:

Gen 0 → Short-lived objects

Gen 1 → Medium-lived objects

Gen 2 → Long-lived objects


The GC periodically scans for unused objects and reclaims their memory.
💡 Pro tip: Dispose unmanaged resources manually using IDisposable and using blocks.


4️⃣ What are the key differences between .NET Core and .NET Framework?

Feature .NET Framework .NET Core / .NET 6+

Platform Support Windows only Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
Performance Slower compared to Core Faster due to optimizations
Deployment Installed system-wide Side-by-side deployment possible
Open Source Partially Fully open-source



5️⃣ How do you handle exceptions in .NET?
Use try-catch-finally for predictable error handling.
Best practices:
✅ Catch specific exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundException) instead of Exception
✅ Log errors for troubleshooting
✅ Use finally for cleanup

Example:

try {
 var data = File.ReadAllText("file.txt");
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
 // Handle missing file
}
finally {
 // Cleanup code
}

🚀 Final Advice:
In interviews, don’t just answer — explain how you’ve applied these concepts in real projects. Recruiters love hearing practical, real-world stories.

🚀 Advanced .NET & C# Interview Q&A — 2025 Edition

Whether you’re a junior stepping into your first technical interview or a senior brushing up before a big role, mastering these questions will give you a strong edge.



1️⃣ Explain the difference between value types and reference types in C#.

Value Types → Stored in the stack. Hold data directly. Examples: int, bool, struct.

Reference Types → Stored in the heap, with variables holding a reference (pointer) to the data. Examples: class, string, array.


💡 Tip: Modifying a value type creates a copy; modifying a reference type affects the original object unless you explicitly clone it.


---

2️⃣ What is the difference between IQueryable and IEnumerable in LINQ?

IEnumerable → Executes queries in memory (client-side). Suitable for in-memory collections like lists.

IQueryable → Executes queries on the data source (e.g., database). Supports expression trees for deferred execution.


💡 Rule of Thumb: Use IQueryable when fetching/filtering from a database; IEnumerable when working with already-loaded collections.



3️⃣ How does async/await handle exceptions?
Exceptions inside an async method are wrapped in a Task. You can catch them using try-catch around the await.

try {
 await DoSomethingAsync();
}
catch (Exception ex) {
 // Handle async error
}

If you forget await, exceptions may not be thrown until the Task is awaited — which can lead to unobserved exceptions.



4️⃣ How do you improve Entity Framework Core performance?
✅ Use AsNoTracking() for read-only queries.
✅ Avoid lazy loading in high-traffic queries; prefer eager loading (Include).
✅ Project only required fields using .Select().
✅ Batch updates/inserts when possible.

Example:

var customers = await _db.Customers
 .AsNoTracking()
 .Where(c => c.IsActive)
 .Select(c => new { c.Id, c.Name })
 .ToListAsync();


---

5️⃣ What is the difference between const, readonly, and static in C#?

const → Compile-time constant. Must be initialized at declaration.

readonly → Can be assigned at declaration or in constructor. Immutable afterward.

static → Belongs to the type, not an instance. Shared across all objects.



💡 Final Tip:
In interviews, don’t just define — demonstrate. For example, instead of saying “AsNoTracking() improves performance,” share how you used it to cut query time by 30% in a real project.



🌐 ASP.NET Core & API Interview Q&A — 2025 Guide

APIs power modern applications, and ASP.NET Core is one of the fastest frameworks for building them. Here’s a set of detailed interview questions with answers to help you shine.



1️⃣ What is middleware in ASP.NET Core?
Middleware is software that sits in the HTTP request pipeline and processes requests/responses.
Examples: Authentication, Logging, Exception Handling.

Example:

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
 // Do something before the next middleware
 await next();
 // Do something after the next middleware
});

💡 Tip: The order of middleware registration matters — authentication must run before authorization.



2️⃣ Difference between REST and gRPC in ASP.NET Core?

Feature REST gRPC

Data Format JSON/XML Protocol Buffers (binary)
Performance Slower Faster due to binary serialization
Communication Text-based HTTP/2 streaming
Use Cases Public APIs Internal microservices




3️⃣ How does dependency injection work in ASP.NET Core?
ASP.NET Core has built-in DI, allowing you to register services in Program.cs or Startup.cs and inject them where needed.

builder.Services.AddScoped<IEmailService, EmailService>();

💡 Lifetime types:

Transient → New instance every time.

Scoped → One instance per request.

Singleton → One instance for the application’s lifetime.




4️⃣ How do you secure an ASP.NET Core Web API?
✅ Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
✅ Use HTTPS to encrypt traffic.
✅ Validate inputs to prevent injection attacks.
✅ Use role-based or policy-based authorization.

Example JWT setup:

builder.Services
 .AddAuthentication("Bearer")
 .AddJwtBearer(options => {
 options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters {
 ValidateIssuer = true,
 ValidateAudience = true,
 ValidateLifetime = true
 };
 });



5️⃣ How do you improve API performance?
✅ Enable response caching.
✅ Use pagination for large datasets.
✅ Optimize database queries.
✅ Compress responses with ResponseCompression.
✅ Consider async programming to free up threads.


🎯 Final Advice:
In API interviews, show that you can balance security, performance, and maintainability. Give examples from real projects where you solved these challenges.

⚡ C# & .NET Core Interview Q&A — 2025 Guide

Mastering C# and .NET Core can make you stand out in backend and full-stack developer interviews. Here are 5 detailed questions with answers to boost your prep.



1️⃣ What is the difference between IEnumerable, IQueryable, and List in C#?

IEnumerable → For in-memory iteration, best for small datasets. Executes queries immediately.

IQueryable → For remote queries (e.g., EF Core to database). Uses deferred execution and builds SQL dynamically.

List → A concrete collection, stored entirely in memory.


💡 Tip: Use IQueryable when you want filtering at the database level.



2️⃣ What is Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET Core?
A design pattern where dependencies are provided rather than created inside a class. Improves testability and maintainability.

Example:

// Register
services.AddScoped<IEmailService, EmailService>();

// Use in constructor
public class AccountController
{
 private readonly IEmailService _emailService;
 public AccountController(IEmailService emailService)
 {
 _emailService = emailService;
 }
}



3️⃣ Difference between Task, ValueTask, and async/await?

Task → Represents an asynchronous operation.

ValueTask → Lightweight, avoids heap allocation for synchronous completions.

async/await → Syntax sugar to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style.


💡 Use ValueTask only when performance testing confirms its benefit.



4️⃣ What is Middleware in .NET Core?
Middleware are components in the request pipeline that process requests and responses.

Example:

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
 // Before
 await next.Invoke();
 // After
});



5️⃣ What is the difference between struct and class in C#?

struct → Value type, stored on stack (usually), no inheritance.

class → Reference type, stored on heap, supports inheritance.


💡 Use struct for small, immutable data structures.


📌 Final Advice:
In C# interviews, demonstrate not just syntax knowledge but also why you’d choose one approach over another based on performance, scalability, and maintainability.



🚀 Mastering Problem-Solving in Technical Interviews
Your guide to impressing interviewers with logical thinking and coding precision.

💡 Why Problem-Solving Skills Matter:
In technical interviews, solving a problem is not just about getting the right answer — it’s about how you approach it, communicate your thought process, and optimize the solution.


Sample Question

Q: Given an array of integers, return the indices of two numbers that add up to a given target.
Example: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 → Output: [0, 1]



Detailed Answer & Approach

Step 1 — Understand the Problem:

Inputs: An array nums and an integer target.

Output: Indices of two numbers that sum to target.

Constraints:

Each input has exactly one solution.

Cannot use the same element twice.



Step 2 — Brute Force Approach:

for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)
{
 for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.Length; j++)
 {
 if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target)
 return new int[] { i, j };
 }
}

Time Complexity: O(n²) — Works, but not optimal.



Step 3 — Optimized Approach (HashMap):

public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target)
{
 Dictionary<int, int> map = new Dictionary<int, int>();

 for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)
 {
 int complement = target - nums[i];
 if (map.ContainsKey(complement))
 return new int[] { map[complement], i };

 if (!map.ContainsKey(nums[i]))
 map.Add(nums[i], i);
 }
 return new int[] { };
}

✅ Time Complexity: O(n)
✅ Space Complexity: O(n)



Pro Tips for Problem-Solving Interviews

1. Clarify Requirements — Avoid assumptions.


2. Think Out Loud — Show your thought process.


3. Start Simple — Brute force first, then optimize.


4. Consider Edge Cases — Empty array, negative numbers, large input.


5. Refactor & Discuss Complexity — Interviewers love this step.

 🚀 System Design Interview Series: Scalability vs. Reliability

When designing large-scale systems, engineers often face trade-offs. Two of the most common pillars in system design are Scalability and Reliability – but balancing them is an art. 🎯



✅ What is Scalability?

Scalability means your system can handle growth – more users, more requests, and bigger datasets – without collapsing.

Example: Adding more servers to handle Black Friday traffic on an e-commerce platform.

Techniques: Load Balancing, Horizontal Scaling, Database Sharding.




✅ What is Reliability?

Reliability ensures your system keeps working consistently even when things go wrong.

Example: Netflix streaming stays online even if one data center fails.

Techniques: Redundancy, Failover, Replication, Health Monitoring.




⚖️ The Trade-off:

A system might be highly scalable but fail often if not designed with redundancy.

A highly reliable system might be expensive and slower to scale.


👉 Great system design balances both.



💡 Interview Tip:
When asked about designing a system, always mention both scalability and reliability in your answer. Show that you understand the trade-offs and can propose solutions that balance them.



🔗 Question for you:
If you had to prioritize one first in a startup product, would you go for Scalability or Reliability – and why? 🤔

 🚀 .NET Updates in 2025: What Every Developer & Tech Leader Should Know
