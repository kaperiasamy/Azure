## ASP.NET Core Overview

- **ASP.NET Core** is a modern, high-performance, open-source web development framework built on the .NET runtime.
- It is designed for building scalable, cross-platform web applications and services.
- The framework is hosted on GitHub and has received over 100,000 contributions from more than 37,000 companies, making it a strong community-driven project.

---

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker containers.
- **Open Source**: Developers can contribute via GitHub by cloning the repository and submitting pull requests.
- **Modern Architecture**: ASP.NET Core is a complete redesign of the legacy ASP.NET Web Forms, which was Windows-only.

## Supported Application Patterns

ASP.NET Core supports several industry-standard development patterns:

| Pattern | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** | Separates application logic, UI, and data. Widely used across many frameworks and languages. This course primarily uses MVC. |
| **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** | Used in Razor Pages. Links C# class files directly to frontend views. |
| **SPA (Single Page Applications)** | Enables dynamic, client-side rendering for modern web apps. |

---

## Razor Pages

- Razor Pages is a simplified web application model in ASP.NET Core.
- It follows the MVVM pattern, where backend logic (C#) is tightly coupled with frontend markup.
- Ideal for page-focused scenarios and beginner-friendly for learning web development.

---

## APIs with ASP.NET Core

- ASP.NET Core allows the creation of **Web APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces).
- APIs enable communication between client-side apps and backend services.
- If you're new to APIs, additional courses are available to deepen your understanding.

## Blazor Framework

Blazor is a powerful frontend framework within ASP.NET Core that uses C# instead of JavaScript:

| Flavor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Blazor Server** | Components are rendered on the server and updated in real-time using SignalR. |
| **Blazor WebAssembly** | Components run entirely in the browser, similar to Angular or React. Requires API integration for backend communication. |

## Final Notes

- ASP.NET Core is a mature, stable, and versatile framework for modern web development.
- It supports modern design patterns, cross-platform deployment, and community-driven innovation.
- Learning ASP.NET Core equips developers with the tools to build robust web applications and APIs using C# across various environments.
