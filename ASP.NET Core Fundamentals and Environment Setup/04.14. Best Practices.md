# ASP.NET MVC Best Practices Cheat Sheet

## 1. Follow Naming Conventions
- **Controller Naming**: Use the format `[RouteName]Controller`.  
  Example: For route `/test`, name the controller `TestController`.
- **View Folder Naming**: Create a view folder that matches the controller name.  
  Example: `TestController` should have a folder named `Test` in the `Views` directory.
- **Action View Naming**: Each action method should have a corresponding view file with the same name.  
  Example: An `Index` action should have a view file named `Index.cshtml` inside the `Test` folder.

## 2. Organize by File Type
- Group similar files into dedicated folders:
  - Controllers go in the `Controllers` folder.
  - Models go in the `Models` folder.
  - Views are organized under the `Views` folder by controller name.
- For new components (e.g., helpers, services), create a **new folder** before adding the file.
- This structure improves **code readability**, **maintainability**, and **team collaboration**.

## Summary
Adhering to consistent naming and folder organization:
- Prevents routing and rendering errors.
- Makes the project easier to navigate.
- Aligns with ASP.NET MVC conventions and expectations.
