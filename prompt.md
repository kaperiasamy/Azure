SOAP vs REST vs RESTFul – What’s the Real Difference in APIs?

I want the answer should include: 
What it is? 
Why it matters – explain the problem it solves. 
Business/technical outcome

Use sample code (only 10 - 15 lines) in C# to get the most acceptable answer.

--- 

## 1. **Creational Patterns** (Object creation mechanisms)

Focus: Making the system independent of how objects are created, composed, and represented.

* **Singleton** – Ensure only one instance of a class, with global access.
* **Factory Method** – Define an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
* **Abstract Factory** – Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying concrete classes.
* **Builder** – Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
* **Prototype** – Create new objects by cloning an existing object (prototype).

---

## 2. **Structural Patterns** (Object composition / class relationships)

Focus: How classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

* **Adapter (Wrapper)** – Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
* **Bridge** – Decouple abstraction from its implementation so the two can vary independently.
* **Composite** – Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* **Decorator** – Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
* **Facade** – Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
* **Flyweight** – Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
* **Proxy** – Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

---

## 3. **Behavioral Patterns** (Object interaction and responsibility)

Focus: How objects communicate and distribute responsibilities.

* **Chain of Responsibility** – Pass a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.
* **Command** – Encapsulate a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.
* **Interpreter** – Define a representation for a language and an interpreter to evaluate sentences in it.
* **Iterator** – Provide a way to sequentially access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.
* **Mediator** – Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
* **Memento** – Capture and restore an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation.
* **Observer (Publish/Subscribe)** – Define a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.
* **State** – Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
* **Strategy** – Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each, and make them interchangeable.
* **Template Method** – Define the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
* **Visitor** – Represent an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure without changing the classes.

Would you like me to now create a **printable A4 quick reference PDF** (Category → Pattern → Short Definition → Real-World Example) so you can carry it as a ready reckoner before interviews?

--- 

Great question 👍. Not all design patterns are equally used in practice. Some are **core and frequently asked in interviews**, while others are more niche. Here’s a **sorted list of GoF design patterns by popularity and real-world use**, based on industry adoption and interview trends:

---

## 🔥 **Most Popular (Core – Frequently Used & Asked)**

You must know these deeply, with code and real-world examples:

* **Singleton** – Configuration, logging, caching, DB connection pool.
* **Factory Method** – Object creation without exposing instantiation logic.
* **Abstract Factory** – Cross-platform UI toolkits, families of related objects.
* **Builder** – Complex object creation (e.g., assembling a Document or Pizza).
* **Strategy** – Switching algorithms dynamically (payment methods, sorting).
* **Observer** – Event handling, pub-sub systems, notifications.
* **Decorator** – Adding responsibilities (logging, compression, encryption).
* **Facade** – Simplified interface to complex subsystems (e.g., PaymentGateway).
* **Proxy** – Lazy loading, access control, remote proxy, API gateways.

---

## ✅ **Moderately Popular (Good to Know, Often Discussed in System Design)**

Used in medium-to-large projects or specific scenarios:

* **Command** – Undo/Redo, queueable operations, microservices.
* **Adapter** – Bridging incompatible APIs (legacy system integration).
* **State** – Workflow systems, vending machines, UI screen flows.
* **Template Method** – Framework hooks, algorithms with fixed steps.
* **Iterator** – Standard collection traversal (built into .NET/C# already).
* **Chain of Responsibility** – Request handling pipelines, middleware, logging filters.
* **Mediator** – Chat systems, reducing coupling in UI components.

---

## 📌 **Less Popular (Niche, Good for Completeness but Rare in Interviews)**

Still useful in specific domains:

* **Prototype** – Object cloning, games, CAD systems.
* **Bridge** – Decoupling abstraction from implementation (UI rendering, drivers).
* **Composite** – Hierarchical data (file system trees, menus).
* **Flyweight** – Memory optimization (fonts, game objects).
* **Visitor** – Operations on object structures (AST traversal, compilers).
* **Memento** – Saving/restoring state (text editors, games).
* **Interpreter** – DSLs, query engines (rare outside compiler/domain-specific tools).

---

## 🎯 **Quick Popularity Ranking (Most → Least Common)**

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Strategy
6. Observer
7. Decorator
8. Facade
9. Proxy

---

✅ **Interview Tip**:
If you’re short on prep time, **master the top 10** with **C# code examples + real-world use cases + diagrams**. For Solution Architect interviews, also connect them to **system design concepts** (e.g., Observer → Event-driven microservices, Strategy → Feature toggles).

---

Would you like me to create a **focused 10-pattern "interview must-know cheat sheet"** (with problem → solution → C# snippet → real-world example) so you can revise in 1–2 hours before your interview?
