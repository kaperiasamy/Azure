To delete a record from a child table when its parent record is deleted, you can use several approaches in a relational database management system. Hereâ€™s how you can answer this question comprehensively, showcasing your expertise while minimizing follow-up questions:

## Approaches to Deleting Records from Child Tables:

### 1. Foreign Key with Cascading Deletes:
**Definition**: This approach defines a foreign key constraint with cascading delete behavior. When you delete a record from the parent table, all related records in the child table will be automatically deleted.

**How to Implement**:
When defining the foreign key, specify the ON DELETE CASCADE option.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Parent (
    ParentId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Child (
    ChildId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ParentId INT,
    Info VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (ParentId) REFERENCES Parent(ParentId) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
**Use Case**: This is often the simplest and most efficient way to manage deletions when there are strict parent-child relationships.

### 2. Manual Deletion in Application Logic:
**Definition**: In this approach, you manually delete records from the child table in your application code before deleting the parent record. This is useful when you need more control over the deletion process or when additional business logic is involved.

Example in C#:

```csharp
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var parent = context.Parents.Include(p => p.Children)
                                .FirstOrDefault(p => p.ParentId == targetParentId);
    
    if (parent != null)
    {
        context.Children.RemoveRange(parent.Children);
        context.Parents.Remove(parent);
        context.SaveChanges();
    }
}
```
**Benefits**: This provides flexibility in managing complex deletion scenarios or handling related business rules, such as logging or user notifications.

### 3. Database Triggers:
**Definition**: You can create a trigger that fires upon deletion of a record in the parent table, automatically deleting related records in the child table.
    
**Example SQL Trigger**:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER DeleteChildRecords
ON Parent
AFTER DELETE
AS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM Child WHERE ParentId IN (SELECT ParentId FROM deleted);
END;
```
**Consideration**: Triggers can introduce complexity and may be harder to maintain, but they can be used in complex scenarios where logic needs to reside at the database level.
