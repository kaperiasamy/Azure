1. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in C#?
    An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must follow, while an abstract class can provide some implementation. Interfaces cannot contain any implementation, whereas abstract classes can have both abstract methods and concrete methods.

2. Explain the concept of dependency injection in C#.
    Dependency injection is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. This promotes loose coupling and enhances testability.

3. What are delegates in C#?
    Delegates are type-safe function pointers that allow methods to be passed as parameters. They can encapsulate a method with a specific signature and are often used for implementing event handling.

4. What is the purpose of the async and await keywords in C#?
    The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous method, while the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the method until the awaited task completes. This allows for non-blocking operations, improving application responsiveness.

5. How does garbage collection work in C#?
    Garbage collection in C# is an automatic memory management feature that reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. The garbage collector runs periodically to identify and free up memory, helping to prevent memory leaks.

What is LINQ and how is it used in C#?
    LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a set of features in C# that allows querying of collections in a concise and readable manner. It can be used with various data sources, including arrays, collections, and databases.

Explain the concept of boxing and unboxing in C#.
    Boxing is the process of converting a value type to an object type, while unboxing is the reverse process. Boxing involves wrapping a value type in an object, which incurs a performance cost due to memory allocation.

What are extension methods in C#?
    Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code. They are defined as static methods in a static class and can be called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.

What is the difference between IEnumerable and IQueryable?
    IEnumerable is used for in-memory collections and executes queries in memory, while IQueryable is designed for querying data from external sources, such as databases, and translates queries into the appropriate format for the data source.

How do you implement a singleton pattern in C#?
    The singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This can be implemented using a private constructor and a static instance property, often with lazy initialization for thread safety.

What is the role of the using statement in C#?
    The using statement is used to ensure that IDisposable objects are disposed of properly. It automatically calls the Dispose method when the object goes out of scope, helping to manage resources efficiently.

Explain the concept of async streams in C#.
    Async streams allow asynchronous iteration over a collection of data. Using IAsyncEnumerable<T>, you can yield results asynchronously, which is useful for scenarios like reading data from a database or a file without blocking the main thread.

What is the difference between Task and Thread in C#?
    A Task represents an asynchronous operation and is managed by the Task Parallel Library, while a Thread is a lower-level construct that represents a separate path of execution. Tasks are generally preferred for asynchronous programming due to their ease of use and better resource management.

How do you handle exceptions in C#?
    Exceptions in C# can be handled using try-catch blocks. You can catch specific exceptions or use a general catch block to handle unexpected errors. Finally blocks can be used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred.

What is the purpose of the lock statement in C#?
    The lock statement is used to ensure that a block of code runs only by one thread at a time, preventing race conditions in multi-threaded applications. It locks a specified object to control access to shared resources.

Explain the difference between ref and out parameters in C#.
    Both ref and out parameters allow passing arguments by reference, but ref requires that the variable be initialized before being passed, while out does not require initialization and must be assigned a value before the method returns.

What is the purpose of the volatile keyword in C#?
    The volatile keyword indicates that a field can be accessed by multiple threads and prevents the compiler from optimizing the access to that field. This ensures that the most recent value is always read from memory.

How do you implement custom attributes in C#?
    Custom attributes can be created by defining a class that derives from System.Attribute. You can then apply this attribute to various program elements, such as classes, methods, or properties, to add metadata.

What is the difference between String and StringBuilder in C#?
    String is immutable, meaning that any modification creates a new string instance, while StringBuilder is mutable and allows for efficient string manipulation without creating multiple instances, making it more suitable for scenarios involving frequent changes.

Explain the concept of covariance and contravariance in C#.
    Covariance allows a method to return a more derived type than originally specified, while contravariance allows a method to accept less derived types. This is particularly useful in generic interfaces and delegates.

What is the purpose of the dynamic type in C#?
    The dynamic type bypasses compile-time type checking, allowing for late binding. This is useful when working with COM objects, dynamic languages, or when the type is not known until runtime.

How do you create a custom collection in C#?
    A custom collection can be created by implementing the IEnumerable<T> interface and providing the necessary methods for adding, removing, and enumerating items. You can also implement ICollection<T> for additional functionality.

What is the difference between Task.Run and Task.Factory.StartNew?
    Task.Run is a simpler method for running a task on the thread pool, while Task.Factory.StartNew provides more options for configuring the task, such as specifying task creation options and scheduling.

Explain the concept of a CancellationToken in C#.
    A CancellationToken is used to signal that an operation should be canceled. It is typically passed to asynchronous methods, allowing them to check for cancellation requests and terminate gracefully.

What is the purpose of the nameof operator in C#?
    The nameof operator returns the name of a variable, type, or member as a string. This is useful for refactoring and maintaining code, as it avoids hardcoding string literals that can become outdated.

How do you implement logging in a C# application?
    Logging can be implemented using various libraries, such as NLog or log4net. These libraries provide flexible logging mechanisms, allowing you to log messages to different outputs, such as files, databases, or external services.

What is the difference between public, private, protected, and internal access modifiers?
    public allows access from anywhere, private restricts access to the containing class, protected allows access to derived classes, and internal restricts access to the same assembly.

Explain the concept of a using directive in C#.
    A using directive allows you to include namespaces in your code, enabling you to use classes and methods without fully qualifying their names. It simplifies code readability and organization.

What is the purpose of the async keyword in C#?
    The async keyword is used to define asynchronous methods, allowing for non-blocking operations. It enables the use of the await keyword within the method, which pauses execution until the awaited task completes.

How do you implement a generic method in C#?
    A generic method can be defined by specifying type parameters in angle brackets after the method name. This allows the method to operate on different data types while maintaining type safety.

What is the difference between == and Equals() in C#?
    The == operator checks for reference equality for reference types and value equality for value types, while the Equals() method can be overridden to provide custom equality logic for objects.

Explain the concept of method overloading in C#.
    Method overloading allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameters (type, number, or order). This enables you to create methods that perform similar functions with different input types.

What is the purpose of the params keyword in C#?
    The params keyword allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments as an array. This is useful for methods that need to handle a flexible number of parameters without requiring explicit array creation.

How do you implement a multi-threaded application in C#?
    Multi-threading can be implemented using the Thread class or the Task Parallel Library (TPL). You can create threads to perform tasks concurrently, improving application performance and responsiveness.

What is the role of the volatile keyword in C#?
    The volatile keyword indicates that a field can be accessed by multiple threads and prevents the compiler from optimizing the access to that field. This ensures that the most recent value is always read from memory.

Explain the concept of a ThreadPool in C#.
    A ThreadPool is a collection of worker threads that can be used to perform background tasks. It manages the allocation and reuse of threads, improving performance by reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads.

What is the difference between abstract and virtual methods in C#?
    An abstract method must be implemented in derived classes and has no implementation in the base class, while a virtual method provides a default implementation that can be overridden in derived classes.

How do you implement a custom exception in C#?
    A custom exception can be created by deriving from the Exception class and providing constructors that allow for message and inner exception parameters. This enables you to throw and catch specific exceptions in your application.

What is the purpose of the lock statement in C#?
    The lock statement is used to ensure that a block of code runs only by one thread at a time, preventing race conditions in multi-threaded applications. It locks a specified object to control access to shared resources.

Explain the concept of yield in C#.
    The yield keyword is used in an iterator method to return each element of a collection one at a time. It allows for lazy evaluation, meaning that elements are generated on-the-fly as they are requested.

What is the difference between IEnumerable and ICollection?
    IEnumerable provides a simple way to iterate over a collection, while ICollection extends IEnumerable by adding methods for adding, removing, and counting items, providing more functionality for collection manipulation.

How do you implement a factory pattern in C#?
    The factory pattern can be implemented by creating a factory class with a method that returns instances of different classes based on input parameters. This encapsulates the object creation logic and promotes loose coupling.

What is the purpose of the new keyword in C#?
    The new keyword is used to create instances of classes or structures. It allocates memory for the object and calls the constructor to initialize it.

Explain the concept of async and await in C#.
    The async keyword is used to define asynchronous methods, while the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the method until the awaited task completes. This allows for non-blocking operations, improving application responsiveness.

What is the difference between Task and ValueTask in C#?
    Task represents an asynchronous operation that may complete in the future, while ValueTask is a lightweight alternative that can be used when the result is often available synchronously, reducing allocations and improving performance.
