# Azure App Services Interview Preparation Guide

This comprehensive guide covers key concepts, advanced scenarios, and common interview questions related to Azure App Services, with a focus on .NET-specific considerations. It's designed for experienced professionals looking to excel in technical interviews.

## I. Core Concepts and Foundational Knowledge

### 1. What is Azure App Services and why would you use it?
Azure App Services is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering enabling developers to build, deploy, and scale web apps, mobile app backends, and API apps. It supports various modern programming languages, including a strong emphasis on .NET (Framework, Core, 5+), Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

**Why use it?**
*   **PaaS Benefits:** Abstracts away infrastructure management (OS patching, server maintenance, networking configurations), allowing developers to focus purely on application code.
*   **Rapid Deployment:** Offers various deployment methods, including robust CI/CD integration.
*   **Built-in Scalability:** Supports both vertical and horizontal scaling, with intelligent autoscaling capabilities.
*   **Zero-Downtime Deployments:** Leverages deployment slots for seamless updates.
*   **Integrated Security:** Provides built-in authentication, authorization, and network isolation features.
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Offers various pricing tiers to match workload requirements and optimizes resource utilization.

### 2. Understanding App Service Plans
An **App Service Plan** defines the underlying compute resources (VMs, CPU, memory, region, operating system, and scaling capabilities) where your app runs. It dictates the environment and performance characteristics available to the App Services hosted within it. Think of it as the server farm configuration.

*   **Relationship to App Service:** An **App Service** (your specific web application instance) runs **on** an App Service Plan. Multiple App Services can share the same App Service Plan, sharing its allocated resources and costs.
*   **Pricing Tiers & Capabilities:**
    *   **Free/Shared:** For dev/test, very low performance, no custom domains. Shared infrastructure.
    *   **Basic:** Dedicated compute, but limited features (no autoscaling, no deployment slots). Suitable for small production workloads.
    *   **Standard:** Standard production tier, includes autoscaling, deployment slots, and daily backups.
    *   **Premium V2/V3:** Enhanced performance (faster CPUs, SSDs), higher scale limits, VNet integration, Private Endpoint support. Ideal for high-traffic or mission-critical applications.
    *   **Isolated:** Runs in a dedicated Azure Virtual Network, providing maximum network isolation, security, and very high scale. Most expensive, used for highly secure or compliance-sensitive enterprise applications (often involves an App Service Environment - ASE).
    *   **Consumption (for Azure Functions):** Serverless, pay-per-execution model primarily for Azure Functions. *While App Services can host functions, the consumption plan is specific to Azure Functions themselves and not traditional App Services.*

### 3. Deployment Slots
Deployment slots are live app environments with their own hostnames, connected to the same App Service Plan. They enable seamless and safe application updates.

*   **Purpose:** Staging, A/B testing, blue/green deployments.
*   **How They Work:** You deploy a new version of your application to a non-production slot (e.g., "staging"). After testing, you can "swap" the staging slot with the production slot. The swap is a simple routing redirection, ensuring zero downtime.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Zero-Downtime Deployments:** Traffic is redirected instantly without service interruption.
    *   **Rollback Capability:** If issues arise post-swap, you can immediately swap back to the previous stable version.
    *   **Pre-warming:** New versions can be warmed up in the staging slot before going live.
    *   **A/B Testing:** Direct a percentage of traffic to a new version in a separate slot for gradual rollout or user feedback.
*   **Configuration & Settings:** Application settings and connection strings can be "slot-specific," meaning they stick to a particular slot during a swap (e.g., a staging database connection string remains with the staging slot).

### 4. Scaling
Azure App Services offers robust scaling options to handle varying loads.

*   **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):** Increasing the **compute capacity** of your existing App Service Plan by moving to a higher pricing tier (e.g., from Basic to Standard, or Standard Standard S1 to S2). This provides more CPU, memory, and disk I/O to your current instances.
*   **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):** Increasing the **number of instances** (VMs) running your App Service. This distributes the load across multiple instances.
    *   **Manual Scaling:** You manually adjust the instance count.
    *   **Autoscaling:** Automatically adjusts the instance count based on pre-defined rules. You define conditions (e.g., CPU utilization above 70% for 5 minutes) and actions (e.g., increase instances by 1).
    *   **Common Metrics for Autoscaling:** CPU percentage, Memory percentage, HTTP queue length, Data In/Out, Disk Queue Length, and custom metrics from Application Insights.

### 5. Custom Domains and SSL
Essential for production applications.

*   **Custom Domains:** Easily bind your custom domain names (e.g., `www.yourcompany.com`) to your App Service. This requires DNS configuration.
*   **SSL/TLS:** Secure your custom domains with SSL certificates.
    *   **Azure-Managed Certificates:** Simplifies certificate management with automatic renewal.
    *   **Custom Certificates:** Upload your own `P.fx` certificates.
*   **SNI SSL vs. IP-based SSL:** SNI (Server Name Indication) allows multiple SSL certificates on the same IP address, making it cost-effective and common. IP-based SSL uses a dedicated IP per certificate, which is older and less common now.
*   **HTTPS Only:** Always enforce HTTPS for all traffic to ensure data encryption in transit.

### 6. Application Settings and Connection Strings
These are key-value pairs stored securely within the App Service environment, making configuration management easy.

*   **Purpose:** Externalize configuration (database connection strings, API keys, feature flags) from application code.
*   **Difference:** "Application Settings" are general key-value pairs (`APP_SETTING_NAME=value`). "Connection Strings" are specifically typed for databases (`SQLAZURECONNSTR_db_name=connection_string`), often benefiting from automatic driver detection.
*   **Slot-Specific Settings:** Critical for deployment slots. You can mark a setting as "slot setting" so it "sticks" with that slot during a swap. This prevents, for example, a staging app from accidentally using a production database.
*   **Key Vault Integration:** For sensitive data, it's best practice to store secrets in Azure Key Vault and reference them in App Service settings using a `@Microsoft.KeyVault(...)` syntax. This prevents secrets from being directly visible in the App Service configuration.

### 7. Diagnostic and Monitoring
Integrated tools are crucial for maintaining application health and performance.

*   **App Service Diagnostics:** Built-in tool in the Azure portal for troubleshooting common problems (e.g., "Web App Down," "Slow Web App"). It provides insights and recommendations.
*   **Application Insights:** Azure's Application Performance Management (APM) service. It provides deep application-level monitoring, including request monitoring, dependency tracking, exception logging, live metrics, and custom event tracking. Essential for .NET applications.
*   **Azure Monitor:** Provides platform-level metrics (CPU, memory, HTTP queue) and activity logs. You can configure alerts based on these metrics.
*   **Log Streams:** Real-time streaming of application logs directly in the Azure portal.
*   **Kudu Console (SCM Site):** An advanced diagnostic console (`yourwebappname.scm.azurewebsites.net`) providing access to file system, process explorer, environment variables, diagnostic dumps, and command-line tools.
*   **App Service Logs:** Configure and collect various logs: Web Server Logs (IIS/Kestrel), Application Logs (from your code), Detailed Error Logs, and Failed Request Tracing. These are invaluable for troubleshooting.

### 8. Security
Securing your App Service is multi-faceted.

*   **Authentication & Authorization (Easy Auth):** Built-in "Easy Auth" simplifies integrating popular identity providers (Azure AD, Microsoft Account, Facebook, Google, Twitter) without writing code. It often pre-authenticates requests before they hit your application.
*   **Managed Identities for Azure Resources (MSI):** Provides an automatically managed identity for your App Service in Azure Active Directory. This allows your App Service to authenticate to other Azure services (e.g., Key Vault, Azure SQL Database, Storage Accounts) securely without managing credentials in code or configuration.
    *   **System-assigned:** Tied to the lifecycle of the App Service.
    *   **User-assigned:** Independent resource, can be assigned to multiple services, useful for shared identities.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Access Restrictions:** Define IP address rules, Service Endpoints (for VNet-bound resources), or HTTP header rules to control inbound traffic.
    *   **VNet Integration:** Allows your App Service to securely access resources *within* your Azure Virtual Network (e.g., internal databases, file shares). Outbound traffic from your App Service originates from an IP within your VNet.
    *   **Private Endpoint:** Exposes your App Service privately to your VNet using a private IP address, eliminating exposure to the public internet. Resources *within* your VNet (or connected via VPN/ExpressRoute) can access the App Service without going over public internet.
*   **Azure Front Door/Application Gateway:** For advanced security features like Web Application Firewall (WAF), DDoS protection, and SSL offloading.
*   **Always On:** Keeps your app loaded and responsive by preventing the worker process from being swapped out due to inactivity, crucial for preventing cold starts for .NET apps.

## II. .NET Specifics in Azure App Services

### 9. Deployment Methods for .NET Apps
Azure App Services provides multiple ways to deploy your .NET applications, catering to various workflows.

*   **Visual Studio / VS Code Publish:** Direct publishing from your IDE (suitable for dev/test).
*   **Azure DevOps (CI/CD Pipelines):** Automates build, test, and deployment on code changes (highly recommended for production).
*   **GitHub Actions:** Similar to Azure DevOps, integrates CI/CD directly with GitHub repositories.
*   **ZIP Deployment / FTP / Web Deploy:** Manual or scripted file transfer methods.
*   **Kudu API:** Programmatic deployment through the SCM site.
*   **Docker Container:** Deploy a custom Docker image (from Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, etc.). This allows you to containerize your .NET application and host it on App Services.

### 10. Runtime Stack and Framework Versions
Crucial for .NET application compatibility.

*   **Configuration:** App Services allows you to select the specific .NET runtime version (e.g., .NET 6 (LTS), .NET 8 (STS)) your application requires.
*   **Self-contained Deployments vs. Framework-dependent Deployments:**
    *   **Framework-dependent:** Relies on the .NET runtime being installed on the server. Smaller deployment package.
    *   **Self-contained:** Includes the entire .NET runtime within your application package. Larger, but guarantees the exact runtime version, useful for specific compatibility needs.
*   **`AspNetCoreModuleV2`:** For ASP.NET Core applications, this IIS module acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests from IIS to Kestrel (the .NET Core web server) and handling out-of-process hosting.

### 11. Configuration Management in .NET
Understanding how App Service settings interact with .NET's configuration system.

*   **Precedence:** In .NET applications, configuration sources are loaded in a specific order, with later sources overriding earlier ones. Environment variables (which App Service settings become) typically override `appsettings.json`.
*   **`appsettings.json`:** Your application's default configuration file.
*   **Environment Variables:** Azure App Service settings and connection strings are exposed to your application as environment variables.
*   **Configuration Providers in .NET:** .NET's configuration system uses providers (e.g., JSON file provider, environment variable provider, command-line provider) to load settings.
*   **Azure Key Vault for Sensitive Data:** As mentioned, referencing Key Vault in App Service settings is the secure way to handle secrets like database connection strings or API keys.

### 12. Dependency Injection and Services
Standard .NET practices apply seamlessly.

*   **How DI Works:** .NET Core/5+ applications use a built-in dependency injection container.
*   **Registering Services:** You register services (e.g., Blob Storage clients, Cosmos DB clients, custom services) in your `Startup.cs` (or `Program.cs` in .NET 6+) and consume them through constructor injection.

### 13. Health Checks
Monitor the health of your .NET application.

*   **Implementing Health Checks:** Use the `Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks` package to define custom health checks (e.g., database connectivity, external service availability).
*   **Integrating with App Service:** Azure App Services can periodically ping a specific health check endpoint (e.g., `/health`) on your application. If this endpoint consistently fails, App Service can decide to restart the instance or take it out of rotation.

### 14. Background Tasks/WebJobs
For long-running or periodic background processes.

*   **What are WebJobs?** A feature of App Services that allows you to run scripts or executables (including .NET console apps) in the same App Service Plan.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Continuous:** Runs constantly.
    *   **Triggered:** Runs on a schedule (CRON expression) or in response to an event (queue message, blob change).
*   **Integration with .NET:** You can develop WebJobs as .NET Console Applications.
*   **Alternatives:** For more complex event-driven or serverless background processes, **Azure Functions** and **Durable Functions** (for orchestrating complex workflows) are often preferred due to their event-driven nature and consumption-based billing.

### 15. Caching Strategies
Optimize performance and reduce load on backend services.

*   **In-Memory Caching:** Simple caching within the application instance using `IMemoryCache` (for .NET). Suitable for a single instance or data that can be recomputed easily.
*   **Distributed Caching (e.g., Azure Cache for Redis):** Crucial for multi-instance deployments. Data is stored externally and accessible by all instances, preventing cache inconsistencies and improving scalability.

## III. Integration and Advanced Scenarios

### 16. Virtual Network Integration
Enables your App Service to communicate privately with resources within an Azure Virtual Network.

*   **Purpose:** Securely access VNets-bound resources (e.g., Azure SQL Managed Instance, internal APIs, Azure Key Vault with VNet service endpoint) without exposing them to the public internet.
*   **How it Works:** Outbound network traffic from your App Service is routed through a delegated subnet within your VNet.
*   **VNet Integration vs. App Service Environment (ASE):** VNet Integration is simpler and suited for connecting to existing VNets. ASE is a completely isolated environment *within* a VNet, offering maximum network isolation and dedicated resources, but at a higher cost and management overhead.
*   **Regional VNet Integration:** Most common type, integrating your App Service with a VNet in the same region.

### 17. App Service Environment (ASE)
A powerful App Service Plan option for enterprise-grade requirements.

*   **When to Use:** When you need a fully isolated, dedicated, and highly scalable environment. Ideal for demanding workloads that require:
    *   Extreme scale out (up to 200 instances).
    *   Strict network isolation (integration into an existing VNet).
    *   Higher memory-to-CPU ratio.
    *   Running apps for internal use cases.
*   **Internal vs. External ASE:**
    *   **Internal:** Only internal VNet IP addresses, accessible via private DNS.
    *   **External:** Public IP address for the load balancer, accessible from the internet.
*   **Cost Implications:** Significant cost due to dedicated resources. Requires more operational management.

### 18. Azure Front Door vs. Application Gateway vs. Traffic Manager
These are distinct services offering different capabilities for managing traffic to your App Services.

*   **Azure Front Door:** Global, scalable entry-point that uses the Microsoft global edge network. Best for:
    *   **Global routing:** Directing traffic to the nearest healthy backend (App Service).
    *   **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Protecting against common web vulnerabilities.
    *   **SSL Offloading:** Centralized SSL certificate management at the edge.
    *   **CDN integration:** For static content.
*   **Azure Application Gateway:** Regional load balancer and WAF. Best for:
    *   **Internal load balancing:** Within a specific region/VNet.
    *   **Path-based routing:** Directing requests to different backends based on URL paths.
    *   **URL Rewriting, Session Affinity.**
    *   **WAF**
*   **Azure Traffic Manager:** DNS-based traffic routing. Best for:
    *   **Global DNS-based load balancing:** Directing users to different endpoints (across regions) based on various routing methods (priority, performance, geographic).
    *   **Disaster Recovery:** Simple failover between regional deployments.

### 19. Azure Storage Integration
Integrating App Services with Azure Storage is common for various use cases.

*   **Blob Storage:** Store static content (images, videos), user uploads, and large files. Access via SDKs or direct URLs.
*   **Table Storage, Queue Storage:** For specific NoSQL or message queuing needs, respectively.
*   **Mounting Azure Files Shares:** Persistent file storage that can be mounted as a drive for your App Service instances. Useful for shared configuration, application logs, or legacy file share requirements.

### 20. Database Connectivity
Connecting your .NET App Service to various Azure databases.

*   **Databases:** Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, PostgreSQL, MySQL.
*   **Connection String Best Practices:** Use App Service connection strings, and for sensitive environments, ensure they are pulled from Key Vault via Managed Identities.
*   **Managed Identities for Database Authentication:** Many Azure databases (Azure SQL, Cosmos DB) support Azure AD authentication. This allows your App Service to authenticate directly using its Managed Identity, eliminating the need to store database usernames/passwords.

### 21. API Management Integration
Exposing your App Service APIs via Azure API Management (APIM).

*   **Purpose:** Centralize API management, enforce policies (rate limiting, quotas), enable security (OAuth, JWT validation), transform requests/responses, and provide developer portals.
*   **Benefits:** Decouples the API consumer from the backend implementation, enhances security, observability, and versioning.

### 22. Identity Management
Securing user access to your .NET application.

*   **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Integration:** Utilize Azure AD for user authentication (e.g., corporate users).
*   **OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0:** Standard protocols supported by App Services Easy Auth and .NET libraries (`Microsoft.Identity.Web`).
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Not for your application's users directly, but for managing permissions to the App Service resource itself within Azure.

### 23. Serverless Functions (Azure Functions)
Understand the distinction and synergy with App Services.

*   **When to Choose Azure Functions:** For event-driven, short-lived, stateless microservices or background tasks (e.g., processing messages from a queue, handlingWebhook events, running scheduled tasks). Pay-per-execution model when using the Consumption Plan.
*   **Consumption Plan vs. Premium Plan vs. App Service Plan:**
    *   **Consumption:** Serverless, scales instantly, pays for execution time/memory.
    *   **Premium:** Pre-warmed instances, VNet connectivity, still event-driven scaling but with more predictable performance, higher cost.
    *   **App Service Plan:** Shared or dedicated compute for functions, offers predictable cost, but you pay for "always on" instances whether they're executing or not.
*   **Integration Scenarios:** Often App Services host the primary web frontend, while Functions handle specific backend tasks, event processing, or scheduled jobs.

### 24. Containerization with App Services (Web App for Containers)
Host Docker images directly on App Services, offering flexibility.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Portability:** Run the same containerized application anywhere.
    *   **Dependency Isolation:** Package all dependencies within the container.
    *   **Environment Consistency:** Ensures the same runtime environment across dev, test, and production.
*   **Usage:** Point your App Service to an image in a container registry (e.g., Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub). App Service manages the container orchestration.
*   **Use Cases:** When you want to control the OS/runtime environment more precisely, or for microservices where each service is a container.

### 25. Deployment Pipelines (CI/CD)
Automating your build, test, and deployment process is critical for efficiency and reliability.

*   **Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions:** The leading platforms for setting up CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Stages, Approvals, Release Gates:** Implement robust pipelines with stages (e.g., build, test, deploy to dev, deploy to staging, deploy to prod), manual approvals, and automated quality gates (e.g., successful tests, security scans) before promoting releases.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Automate everything manageable.
    *   Use feature branches, pull requests.
    *   Implement blue/green deployments with slots.
    *   Version control all pipeline definitions (YAML).

## IV. Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### 26. Common App Service Errors and Solutions
A practical understanding of troubleshooting is key.

*   **HTTP 5xx Errors (Server-Side Errors):**
    *   **500 Internal Server Error:** Most common. Check Application Logs, Diagnostic Logs, Application Insights for exceptions and stack traces. Use Kudu to inspect `D:\home\LogFiles`.
    *   **503 Service Unavailable:** Often due to app crashing, hitting resource limits (CPU/memory exhaustion), or deployment issues. Check "Diagnose and Solve Problems" in Azure portal, restart the app.
*   **Deployment Failures:** Check deployment logs in the Deployment Center. Often due to missing dependencies, wrong frameworks, or build issues.
*   **Cold Start Issues:** First request after inactivity takes longer. Mitigate with "Always On," Premium plans (pre-warmed instances), and efficient application startup. For .NET, optimize `Program.cs`/`Startup.cs` initialization.
*   **Memory and CPU Exhaustion:** Monitor metrics in Azure Monitor. If continuous, scale up or out. Use Kudu's Process Explorer to identify high resource consumers.

### 27. Performance Optimization
Getting the most out of your App Service.

*   **Caching Strategies:** Leverage distributed caching (Redis) for frequently accessed data.
*   **Database Query Optimization:** Profile and optimize SQL queries. Use effective indexing.
*   **Efficient Logging:** Avoid excessive or chatty logging in production, as it can be an I/O bottleneck. Use structured logging.
*   **Choosing Appropriate App Service Plan:** Select a plan that meets anticipated peak load requirements.
*   **Code Optimization:** Profile your .NET application to identify bottlenecks in your code (e.g., inefficient loops, excessive allocations, sync over async I/O).

### 28. Cost Management
Be mindful of Azure costs.

*   **Monitoring Spending:** Utilize Azure Cost Management to track expenses by resource group, service, or tag.
*   **Optimizing App Service Plan Tiers and Instance Counts:** Downsize plans during off-peak hours (if appropriate), use autoscaling effectively, and choose the most cost-effective tier.
*   **Understanding Billing:** App Service Plans are billed regardless of whether apps are running. Scale down or consolidate plans when not needed.

### 29. Disaster Recovery and High Availability
Ensuring application resilience.

*   **Geo-Redundancy with Traffic Manager:** Deploy your App Service to multiple Azure regions and use Azure Traffic Manager (DNS-based) to route users to the healthy, nearest region.
*   **Backup and Restore:** Use App Service's built-in backup feature for periodic snapshot backups of your application files and database.
*   **Multi-Region Deployments:** Essential for mission-critical applications to withstand regional outages. Combine with Azure Front Door for global routing and WAF.

### 30. ARM Templates/Bicep for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Automate infrastructure deployments.

*   **Advantages of IaC:** Declarative, repeatable, version-controlled, reduces human error.
*   **Using IaC:** Define your App Services, App Service Plans, VNet integrations, custom domains, and associated resources (databases, Key Vaults) directly in ARM templates (JSON) or Bicep (more concise DSL).

### 31. Custom Startup Commands for .NET Apps
Tailor your application's startup within the App Service environment.

*   **Usage:** Configure a startup command in your App Service settings (e.g., `dotnet MyWebApp.dll`). For Linux App Services and Docker containers, you might use `startup.sh` or a custom Docker `ENTRYPOINT`.

### 32. WebSockets and SignalR
Real-time communication for web applications.

*   **Enabling WebSockets:** App Services supports WebSockets. Ensure your .NET application is configured (`app.UseWebSockets()`).
*   **Azure SignalR Service:** For complex, large-scale real-time applications with ASP.NET Core SignalR, offloading the connection management to Azure SignalR Service greatly improves scalability and reliability, freeing your App Service instances.

### 33. Environment Variables
Standard way to inject runtime configuration.

*   **In App Services:** App settings and connection strings are exposed as environment variables.
*   **Precedence:** Understand how environment variables override other configuration sources in your .NET application.

### 34. Run from Package
A recommended deployment method for App Services.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Performance:** Files are mounted directly, avoiding local file copy overhead.
    *   **Atomicity:** Deployment is fully atomic; either the entire package is loaded or none.
    *   **Cold Start Reduction:** Faster application startup, especially problematic for Node.js or Python.
    *   **Read-only File System:** Disk access is faster and more reliable.

### 35. Kudu Console/Tools
The powerful diagnostic portal for App Services (`.scm.azurewebsites.net`).

*   **Capabilities:** File system navigation, process explorer, environment variable viewer, diagnostic dumps, WebJobs management, site extensions, SSH/Bash access (for Linux App Services). Invaluable for deep troubleshooting.

### 36. Managed Service Identity (MSI) / Managed Identities
Reiterating its importance.

*   **System-assigned vs. User-assigned:** System-assigned is simpler for single-resource identity; user-assigned for shared identity across multiple resources.
*   **Security Benefit:** Eliminates hardcoding or managing credentials for Azure resource access. Follows the principle of least privilege.

### 37. Diagnostic Logs (Revisited)
Crucial to set up and analyze proactively.

*   **Types:** Application logs (from your code, e.g., Serilog, NLog), Web Server logs (IIS/Kestrel access logs), Detailed Error logs, Failed Request Tracing.
*   **Integration:** Send logs to Storage Account, Event Hubs, and ideally, Log Analytics Workspace for centralized querying and alerting with KQL.

### 38. Site Extensions
Add functionality to your App Service beyond default capabilities.

*   **Purpose:** Install tools like Azure DevOps Agents, Application Insights Agent, custom diagnostic tools, or other utilities via the Azure Marketplace or directly.

### 39. Continuous Delivery
The overarching concept for automated, reliable deployments.

*   **Implementation:** Achieved through robust CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions) and leveraging App Service features like deployment slots.

### 40. Private Endpoints
Securing *inbound* access to your App Service.

*   **How it Works:** Creates a private IP address within your VNet for your App Service, meaning traffic to your app never traverses the public internet. This enhances security and compliance.
