## Recommended Introduction (2-3 minutes)

```
Good morning/afternoon. I'm Periasamy Kanagavel, and I bring over 16 years of experience in software development with a strong focus on technical architecture and leadership.

Currently, I'm serving as an Associate Technical Product Expert at Aptean India, where I've been working on enterprise solutions for the manufacturing industry. One of my key achievements there was architecting and delivering a cloud-native inventory validation system for hospitals using Azure services, which involved React.js frontend, ASP.NET Core Web API backend, and various Azure components like App Services, API Gateway, and Key Vault.

My technical expertise spans the full stack—I'm proficient in C# and .NET technologies, modern JavaScript frameworks like React, and I have extensive hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure cloud services. I've successfully modernized legacy systems by migrating WCF services to ASP.NET Core Web APIs, which improved performance and reduced technical debt significantly.

What I particularly enjoy is the architectural aspect of software development—designing scalable, distributed systems while ensuring they align with business objectives. I've led cross-functional teams, mentored junior developers, and consistently championed best practices like code reviews, CI/CD, and secure coding standards.

I'm also a certified Professional Scrum Master and thrive in Agile environments where collaboration and continuous improvement are valued.

I'm excited about this Technical Architect opportunity at WhiteBlue because it aligns perfectly with my passion for building cloud-native solutions and leading technical initiatives. I'm particularly drawn to your focus on AI-driven transformation and would love to contribute my architectural expertise to help achieve those goals.
